        "OBJECTIVES": " Assertive behaviour is one of the components of successful and easy communication and is one of the major soft skills of the 21st century. Multilingualism is the norm when it comes to the linguistic equipment of our society. In this course, we will introduce multilingual minds from the perspective of psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics and highlight the possible advantages and disadvantages of multilingualism. We will also take a look at multilingual speakers from the perspective of European language policy and show how this perspective affects language learning. In this course you will develop your linguistic and socio-cultural competences. You will learn how to develop the skills to express your own ideas, beliefs and needs with respect for other people, how to react in a conflict or uncomfortable situation, how to prevent provocation or manipulative techniques in communication and, last but not least, how to calmly defend your own boundaries. The course consists of two parts and involves working on assertiveness not only from a psychological point of view, but also in terms of language clich\u00e9s, which also increases confidence in communication.

The common denominator of research in the 21st century across disciplines is research data, which is the cornerstone of scientific work in different disciplines. Scientific data is now coming to the fore in terms of applicability, communication and credibility of the research. However, the view of, access to, and principles for working with scientific data vary greatly depending on the scientific discipline.\n    You can look forward to lectures by successful MU researchers across research disciplines who will introduce you to practical research issues and the use of data in their research. You will be able to compare what research practice entails in your home faculty's disciplines and how researchers in other fields approach research and work with data. Understanding their ways of thinking and needs will allow you to better understand the world and research outside of your domain. It may help future collaborations with colleagues with different work and interests. ",

The tasks for both the text and the audio/video recordings allow practice in different aspects of linguistic competence such as grammar, syntax, stylistics, vocabulary and comprehension. Individual exercises are divided into these categories, allowing students to focus on a particular area according to their preferences. Thus, they can work only with exercises focused on grammar or, conversely, only on vocabulary development, allowing for targeted and effective learning. In total, there are 13 topics (units) in the e-learning. There are 6 topics in the natural sciences and engineering, and 7 topics in the human sciences. Each topic is divided into 3 ROPOTs according to content (most often vocabulary, comprehension and grammar). The only exception is Dr. Kaku and reviews, this topic is divided into 5 ROPOTs for better clarity. Human Sciences - Formative assessment - The Gender Dimension of Science, Size Matters - Irregular verbs - Reducing linguistic diversity affects our perception of the world - Differences in boys' and girls' mathematical and reading literacy and early selection: trends in both countries after the division of Czechoslovakia - Linguistic diversity and the causes of its threat in the 21st century - Assessment and evaluation in the educational process Natural and Engineering Sciences - CO2 - Artificial intelligence and programming - Dr. Kaku and reviews - Physics - Is it possible to make a Jedi lightsaber in real life? - Information Technology ",

This will allow the students to assess the past-present linkages and their relevance today (as in how the communist past still plays a significant role in this part of Europe and why this is so). Hence, the course will enable the students to fully understand not only the historical perspective of the given region but also the major political and societal issues that Central and Eastern Europe has been facing in contemporary times. Last of all, the course program has one field/study trip planned (most likely a local one), providing the students with the possibility to experience the communist past for themselves and see the way it has come to define the present (in this case of one of the CEE countries, the Czech Republic).

The reading materials provided in the Information System (see the Learning materials folder) and the lecture content will be included in the exam. These readings, listed in separate folders according to the names of the lectures, will be made available to the students a week before the start of the course. The number of pages to be read per week shall be, at most, 38. *Final exam: 40 points The exam consists of 5 open questions requiring longer answers (2-3 paragraphs on each question). Students will be asked to prove that they have acquired enough knowledge about the topics covered throughout the course, showing that they can critically discuss the dynamics in the region from historical and theoretical points of view. *Presentations on the selected topics (to be uploaded by the students to the respective IS folder before the presentation): 30 points Each presentation will be about 20min long, consisting of a short summary/background to the given topic, critical analysis of the problem at hand, and questions for the in-class discussion. The following topics/seminars are to be chosen by the students when presenting: 5, 7, and 10. The students are to choose a controversial politician, a populist political platform, and/or an anti-European political movement/party from either Central Europe or the Balkans, present on his/her/their political career/influence and discuss their political relevance concerning the post-socialist development of both regions, paying particular attention to the specificities of these regions. It is expected that the max number of students per group shall not exceed 4. The students will have applied for the topics/groups of their choice by October 10 (reporting directly to Dr. Taterov\u00e1). The failure to do so will significantly influence one\u2019s score, as the student will effectively lose the points they would usually have by presenting to their peers. **Active participation is expected but not required.

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course is designed to give students a complex insight into the issue of making and breaking of Central and Southeast Europe, the two regions that may geographically be very close to each other but that have arguably had (quite) different historical trajectories. The course opens by addressing the concepts of both regions, continues by tackling history and politics in the 20th century of these parts of Europe thus opening the space for the discussions on totalitarian ideologies, ethnic divisions, and, among others, nationalism. The course additionally informs on the past-present links as well as new threats, such as the growing populism and Russian propaganda alike. More than that, the students taking the course shall also benefit from a field trip, providing them with an opportunity to more closely inspect and address the major issues that the course covers by comparatively tending to the regions at hand.

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " *Mid-term exam: 30 points This exam consists of 3 open questions requiring longer answers (2-3 paragraphs on each question). The goal is to check whether students have acquired the basic knowledge in the first part of the course. The literature in the Information System and the lecture content will both be included in the exam. These readings, listed in separate folders according to the names of the lectures or their dates, will have been made available to the students one week before the start of the course. The number of pages to be read per week shall not exceed 40. *Final exam: 30 points The exam consists of 3 open questions requiring longer answers (2-3 paragraphs on each question). Students will be asked to prove that they have acquired enough knowledge about the topics covered throughout the second part of the course (from the mid-term exam on), showing that they can critically discuss the issues within both regions. *Presentation on the selected topics (to be uploaded by the students to the respective IS folder before taking place): 30 points Each presentation will be about 20min long, consisting of a short summary/background to the given topic, critical analysis of the problem at hand, and questions for the in-class discussion. The following topics/seminars may be chosen by students when presenting: a) Stalinism as a totalitarian system b) Munich 1938, or how Western Europe caved before Hitler c) Ethnic Diversity in the (Western) Balkans: Cultural richness, or a conflict-ridden past and future? d) Russian propaganda in the Balkans/Post-Yugoslav space The students are to choose a topic by applying for it at the third lecture (March 6), informing the teacher that they will be presenting on an agreed date. It is expected that the max number of students per group shall not exceed 2-3. The failure to present will significantly influence one\u2019s score, as the student will effectively lose the points they would normally have/get by presenting to their peers. **Active participation (10 points) is expected but not required. Students are strongly recommended to go through the assigned readings before the lectures and join the discussions. This makes the lessons more interactive, allowing the students to broaden their horizons in this regard.

Courses conducted in English are based on the principles of experiential pedagogy and andragogy and target foreigners living in the Czech Republic. The programme is designed to be interactive, introducing participants to Brno through literature, music, art, film, etc. Although the basic topics related to our society and the city of Brno are usually included in regular language courses, the concept of the courses does not usually allow for more space to be devoted to these topics. The experiential form, which forms the backbone of the course, allows, thanks to its character, to go beyond the merely informative framework in presenting our culture and society, and thanks to the experience it allows participants to better understand certain specifics of Czech society. In this way, participants will be able to gain a more comprehensive picture of the city in which they live, study or work, which forms the basis for easier and more natural integration into life in Czech society. The emphasis is on autonomous learning. Gamification elements are included to diversify the activities. The target group includes foreign students and foreign MU employees. ",
