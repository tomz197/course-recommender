Students are required to demonstrate whether there are relevant data and information sources to achieve the proposed objectives of theses and whether those sources are at their disposal. The student is obliged to prove, whether there are relevant information and data sources that will enable to achieve the aim. If this condition is not satisfied, it is not possible to set the supervisor approve to the assignment. No later than at the beginning of the examination period, all this must be agreed between the student and supervisor of theses. Then the supervisor must entry the agreed assignment into the IS by the end of the second week of the examination period. Based on an embedded assignment in IS student will then be awarded by credit by the supervisor confirming that he agrees with the assignment of theses. The above information suggests primarily student, supervisor performs technical supervision and possibly corrects subject, aim, methods, procedures and literature. Supervisor is not required to propose his own topic, an active approach of students to the creation of assignment is expected. Responsibility for the topic is fully borne by the student, the subsequent basic prerequisite of the final theses is the fulfillment of the set aim and clearly identifiable student's own contribution (ie application of theoretical knowledge to practical solution of chosen problem).

        "OBJECTIVES": " Logistics and supply chain management or the integration of logistics with other business functions and the integration of a business with companies in the supply chain can be considered as a source of competitive advantage. Especially for commercial enterprises, which are one of the participants in the supply chain, the functioning of logistics processes is an essential condition for their survival. With the growth of globalization and networking across the supply chain across borders, we are often talking about supply chain competitiveness. Integration can lead to improved customer service when properly and comprehensively managed, including risk-taking. The integration process supports deepening digitization as part of the new era Company 4.0. The development of information and system technologies is what promotes the efficient functioning of logistics processes, but which has an impact not only on the level of customer service but also on costs. Logistics is primarily understood as a service within the course, therefore the interpretation is based on basic theoretical concepts related to management and marketing of services.\n\n    The aim of the course is to introduce logistics and supply chain management as disciplines which have a significant impact on the competitiveness of business enterprises and value created for customers, because it crosses several business functions due to its cross-cutting nature.\n\n    The course is therefore focused on:\n    1) understanding of the importance of logistics for the competitiveness of a business and the customer value;\n    2) understanding of the logistics process and logistics decisions in the enterprise and in the supply chain in relation to their cost impact and customer service\n    3) familiarization with the technologies that are necessary for supply chain management and which are necessary in the knowledge-based and, above all, globalizing society.

Students are required to contact the supervisor of their potential final theses during the first two weeks of the semester (ideally in consultation hours or final theses seminar, or via email) and discuss and agree to the content of their theses, which must contain data in the following structure:\n\n    - Title in Czech and English,\n    - Aim of theses,\n    - The procedure of the theses and the subsequent draft outline headings including first to third level (student demonstrates this relationship on a track of it and the ability to organize information on the necessary way; detailed outline form will not be included in the specification, but it is the basis for the supervisor to decide opening the topic),\n    - Methods used, with links to each part of the curriculum, i.e. which method will be used in specific chapters and how,\n    - Literature and other sources (monographs, textbooks, articles, internet sources, etc.\n    - it is expected to close research resources by the student; the quality is also reflected in the decision of opening the topic.\n\n    Students are required to demonstrate whether there are relevant data and information sources to achieve the proposed objectives of theses and whether those sources are at their disposal. The student is obliged to prove whether there are relevant information and data sources that will enable to achieve the aim.\n    If this condition is not fulfilled, it is not possible to approve the draft of final theses by the supervisor.\n    No later than at the beginning of the exam period, all this must be agreed between the student and supervisor of theses. Then the supervisor must entry the agreed assignment into the IS by the end of the second week of the exam period. Based on an embedded assignment in IS student will then be awarded by credit by the supervisor confirming that he/she agrees with the assignment of theses.\n    The student primarily proposes the above information, the supervisor performs technical supervision and, if necessary, corrects the topic, objective, methods, procedure and literary sources so that the final thesis complies with the standards imposed on this type of work.\n    Thesis supervisors are not obliged to propose their own topics unless there is an active student's approach to assignment development. Responsibility for the topic is fully born by the student; the subsequent fundamental prerequisite of the final theses is the fulfilment of the set aim and identifiable student's own contribution (ie. Not only the simple transfer from other sources or simple description but also the students' ability to propose their own evaluation and application of theoretical knowledge to practical solutions related to the selected problem).

It is based on thorough understanding of the principles of the real estate market and its specifics; attention is devoted to the public interest, land use planning and real estate register. The significance of and the reasons for real estate valuation are explained in the practice. The actual valuation starts with clarifying the procedures for land value determination (either using price maps of building sites or using calculation) and fruit trees and decorative plants value determination. Further attention is given to the cost, comparison and profit approach to building and flat valuations. All procedures are illustrated using practical examples, which enables the right interpretation of the found prices in dependence on the methods used. The entire course works with the idea of spatial differentiation of property values.\n\n    The course objective is to equip the students with knowledge about the ways, methods and the significance of land, building and natural resources valuation. The understanding of the construction of individual methods will enable the students to interpret the methods correctly. Moreover, thanks to our conception of the subject, they will also grasp the wider perspective of the real estate market, the relationship between the market and the administrative prices and also the significant legal and administrative aspects of the market and the real estates themselves.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Spatial planning refers to the methods used by the public sector to influence the future distribution of activities in spaces of various scales. It is undertaken with the aims of creating a more rational territorial organisation of land uses and the linkages between them, to balance demands for development with the need to protect the environment, and to achieve social and economic objectives. Spatial planning embraces measures to co-ordinate the spatial impacts of other sectoral policies, to achieve a more even distribution of economic development between regions than would otherwise be created by market forces, and to regulate the conversion of land and property uses. Spatial planning includes all levels of land use planning including urban planning, regional planning, national spatial plans, and in the European Union international levels. In lectures fundamental information about spatial planning in the EU and Czech Republic is supplied, its objectives and problems, its fundamental concepts and tools, together with guidance to the course literature. In papers the skills and capacity for applying, analysing, and communicating acquired knowledge is trained. In addition, the ability to independently obtain and assess new information is trained. ",

The examination seeks to test students\u2019 knowledge, understanding and learning competencies from the lecture and seminar series, and their ability to synthesise that knowledge and answer specific questions relating to the course material.\n    It is necessary to gain more than 60 % of overall assessment (paper + written examination) to pass the exam.

        "OBJECTIVES": " There is much evidence to suggest that the standard economic paradigms of rational investors and efficient markets do not adequately describe financial market behaviour. Behavioral finance studies how individuals' attitudes and behaviors affect their financial decisions and financial markets. This course summarizes current research on the behavioral aspects of individual investment decision making (microbehavioral finance) and how it differs from the efficient markets paradigm (macrobehavioral finance). In addition, the course examines behavioral finance models to explain investor behavior and market anomalies when rational models do not provide sufficient explanations. The course focuses, among other topics, on overconfidence, prospect theory, heuristics and the resulting biases, the impact of information on decision making, and framing areas. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the course is to acquaint students with key aspects of corporate finance, with emphasis on the importance of financial management both in the economy and in the whole field of finance. The course is designed in two interrelated areas. The first part of the course will be devoted to the basics and then advanced methods of financial analysis. The aim of this part of the course will be to understand and evaluate the financial situation of the company, based on a detailed analysis of corporate statements, including the formulation of recommendations for such a company. The second part of the course will focus on individual methods of evaluation of investment projects. This part of the course is based on the issue of time value of money and further develops it into the issue of capitalization, discounting, and net present value. Furthermore, attention will be paid to theoretical concepts based on which financial decisions are formulated. The second part will also analyze selected types of securities from the perspective of the issuing company and investors and evaluate how the decision on individual methods of financing affects the financial situation of the company.

Any form of cheating, recording or leaking of tests, using unauthorized aids, communication tools, or any other disruption of the exam's objectivity (final assessment) will be considered a failure to meet the course requirements and a serious violation of academic regulations. As a result, the instructor will grade the exam with an \"F\" in the student information system, and the dean will initiate disciplinary proceedings, which may result in the termination of studies.

Students are required to contact the head of their potential bachelor theses during the first two weeks of the semester (ideally in consultation hours or diploma (bachelor) seminar, the combined students through e - mail) and discuss and agree to the content of their theses, which must contain data in the following structure: - Title in Czech and English, - Aim of theses, - The progress of the theses and the subsequent draft outline headings including first to third level ( student demonstrates this relationship on a track of it and the ability to organize information on the necessary way ; detailed outline form will not be included in the specification, but it is the basis for the supervisor to decide opening the topic, - Methods used, with links to each part of the curriculum, i.e. which method will be used in specific chapters and how, - Literature and other sources (monographs, textbooks, articles, internet sources, etc. ) - it is expected to close research resources by the student , the quality is also reflected in the decision of opening the topic. Students are required to demonstrate whether there are relevant data and information sources to achieve the proposed objectives of theses and whether those sources are at their disposal. If a topic is to include the application part, the student is required to research the data sources , and if necessary to contact practitioners to demonstrate their willingness to cooperate (if necessary) and to identify specific sources for an application part . If this condition is not satisfied, it is not possible to set the supervisor approve to the assignment. No later than at the beginning of the examination period, all this must be agreed between the student and supervisor of theses. Then the supervisor must entry the agreed assignment into the IS by the end of the second week of the examination period. Based on an embedded assignment in IS student will then be awarded by credit by the supervisor confirming that he agrees with the assignment of theses. The above information suggests primarily student, supervisor performs technical supervision and possibly corrects subject, aim, methods, procedures and literature. Supervisor is not required to propose his own topic, an active approach of students to the creation of assignment is expected.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Business Logistics is the introductory graduate course. The objective of the course is to give students a managerial knowledge of basic logistics concepts and principles. The first part of the course focuses on the logistics of an individual firm. Emphasis is placed on the analysis, planning, and management of activities that serve to value-add to the strategic positioning of a firm to increase its competitive position.\n    The second part of the course aims to long term relationships with customers and suppliers i.e. supply chain management (SCM). Therefore the distinction between logistics and supply chain management is examined in the first step and a framework for supply chain management is discussed afterwards.

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course synthesizes knowledge from previous studies in computer science and economics. Students will learn the principles of designing and implementing Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP) in companies, the benefits of using these tools, and the security risks involved. The characteristics of these systems, their categorization, an overview of the systems on the market, and basic terminology will be provided. Aspects related to the implementation of these systems and the management of implementation projects will be discussed. The marketing methods used in selling ERP and the characteristics of the market segment for this commodity will be addressed. Students will be introduced to a selected ERP's structure and essential functions from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Each student will work on their database instance, made accessible using cloud technology. The course includes an introduction to selected process management techniques used in managing implementation projects and for management and decision support following the interpretation of information provided by ERP systems expressly. It includes the Theory of Constraints, project management using the Critical Chain Method, Balanced Score Card, basics of OLAP technology, and selected market analysis tools such as Balanced Score Card, Boston Matrix, Gartner Magic Matrix, Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram, Pareto Analysis, Kepner-Tregoe Method and the use of process optimization tools using the Linear Programming Method. The following will be presented: the basics of the principles and use of Little's Law, the principles of the Drum-Buffer-Rope, and the Yield Management method. The course's main objectives are: understanding the reasons for using an ERP system as an indispensable tool for process management; learning the primary links and functions of ERP itself; learning about the market and the nature of the business of selling software products and associated services. The processes modeled in the Business Central system will allow an understanding of how processes work in companies and how they can be managed. It will enable an understanding of the basis of modern management methods and the definition of problems \" embedded\" in several business and production processes where customers expect the use of ERP tools to help reduce the negative impact of these problems, defining the benefits that customers expect from a successful ERP implementation. Each student will encounter these issues daily in their future work experience, and the knowledge gained in this course will give them a better understanding and a distinct competitive advantage\u2014the learning outcomes of PIS1 serve as a prerequisite for the follow-up course BPH_PIS2. Students will learn how to set up and operate the system, which is required for the follow-up course. Students will use the Business Central system 4 hours weekly in the follow-up course. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The subject is related to the knowledge acquired in the preceding courses, particularly the ones based on Computer science and economics such as Introduction to computer science and Introduction to information technologies, Accounting or subjects related to Company management.

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " For standard full-time study the courses will be split into 13 blocs of lectures and every block will be 2 hours. Related seminars will also be split into 13 blocs and every block will be 2 hours. The subject is not provided for combined or other forms of study except for full-time study. Taking into consideration the complex characteristics of the subject the tuition requires, that the course switches often from lectures to hands-on procedures and vice versa, so the attendance is mandatory for lectures and seminars. In every lesson the teacher will require discussion about the subject and will present real case studies from his expertise for a better understanding of usage of managerial methods and tools. Students will be supplied by the latest available demo version of an ERP system and it is expected, that this demo version will be installed on their private computers in order to check acquired skills during self study. The student ability to operate demo version of ERP during seminars will be continuously checked by teacher. The first part of the final exam will consist of a written part, in which the student will prepare a basis for the subsequent oral exam about managerial methods and the second hands on part where the student will present a required example of a daily processes in ERP. The question will be supplied in advance and will be stored on the university server.The manuals and power points presentation related to every provided chapter will be stored on that server as well as written materials, which help to model required processes in ERP system. Any copying, keeping a record of tests or carrying the tests out, using forbidden aids including any communication devices or any other breach of objectivity of the exam is regarded as a failure to meet the obligations of the subject and as a serious breach of study regulations. As a consequence, the teacher grades the student with \"F\" and the dean is allowed to initiate a disciplinary action, which might lead to the termination of the studies. The questions used for BPH_PIS1 testing is considered as a basics for questions used for Bachelor's final state examination. The acquired knowledge of BPH_PIS1 will be useful for elaboration of Bachelor's thesis. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " Annotation The structure of the course, which follows the BPH_PIS1 course, is conceived so that students use all the knowledge acquired in the previous classes. Topics covered: financial management, cash flow budgets, and analytical tools. Business cases will be solved using Business Central tools. These include frame contracts, substitutions, reservations, ATP/CTP, drop shipments, combined invoicing, SKUs, non-stock items, MRP replenishment, etc. CRM application and its use, advanced logistics, and basics of production planning and assembling will be reviewed. Also, distribution management uses production batches, serial numbers, and expiry dates. Drum-Buffer-Rope and Kepner-Tregoe methods will be used. Metrics, Pareto analysis, and OLAP technology will also be discussed. Main objectives of the course Understanding the reasons for using ERP as a process management tool; learning the main links and functions of an ERP system (MS Dynamics 365 Business Central); learning about the ERP market and the business processes associated with the sale of goods and services; understanding the basics of modern management methods and defining the problems that often affect business and manufacturing processes. An integral part of this is an introduction to the skills required to understand customer needs and the appropriate optimum setup of an ERP system during the implementation process, the ability to demonstrate the impact of any misguided management decisions and an understanding of the benefits that customers expect and believe they can achieve with a properly implemented ERP system. Every student will likely face these problems professionally, and the knowledge gained will be instrumental in solving them. It is known that there is a lack of qualified consultants in the market. Improving students' understanding of these issues through completing this course gives students a competitive advantage. It is one of the main objectives of BPH_PIS2. ERP installation on the home PC will not be required for cloud use. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The subject is related to the knowledge acquired in the preceding courses, particularly the ones based on computer science and economics such as Introduction to computer science, Information technologies and subjects related to Company management and enterprise processes and lastly a subject BPH_PIS1, where the successful pass of this subject is understood as a necessary prerequisite and therefore considered as an unavoidable condition. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The course is divided into 13 blocks of two hours for full-time study. The course is 0/4, which is to say that it is 2 x 2 hours of seminars. At the beginning of each workshop, the theoretical basics of the subject matter are explained and then modeled on the MS Dynamics 365 Business Central system. The course is not intended for either combined or distance learning. The complex nature of the course requires a type of teaching built as a combination of short passages on theory with subsequent modeling of practical examples. For this reason, student participation in BPH_PIS2 is compulsory in both seminars. During the class, the instructor requires discussion on the topics discussed, and students' reactions to real-life examples are expected, which are continuously translated in the course to understand better the applicability of the tools and methods taught. Thanks to cloud technology, students can connect to Business Central from anywhere, allowing home preparation for required presentations of the system functionality discussed. The instructor continuously reviews knowledge and ability to operate the ERP system in class. The final assessment consists of a written part in which the student prepares materials for an oral examination of the methods discussed and a practical demonstration of the use of the Business Central ERP system. The questions are always addressed with the students in advance, and once they have been explained, they are stored on the server in the study materials in the relevant MS TEASM folder and the interactive syllabus. The study materials also include a set of power-point lectures, where the individual files are always saved after the course, again to the locations already mentioned. Both the Business Central database used, and all study materials are in English. The teaching is in Czech. The questions from BPH_PIS2 form the basis of the questions used in the state final Bachelor's exams in Enterprise Information Systems. Any copying, recording, or taking out tests, use of unauthorized aids and communication devices, or any other interference with the examination's objectivity will be considered a failure to meet the course requirements and a gross violation of the study regulations. As a result, the instructor will close the examination with a grade of \"F\" in IS, and the Dean will initiate disciplinary proceedings, which may result in termination.\n    The course cannot be taken if the student is abroad at the time of the course.

        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Lectures and seminars, modelling the typical case studies by using chosen ERP system and related discussions, self study, hands-on ERS systems. For better understanding of ERP student will be supplied by training materials including e-learning files ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the course is to deepen and broaden students\u2019 theoretical and practical knowledge of the basics of law. Students will learn to understand the law as a complex system that operates as the framework for the functioning of the economy. This course will provide them with the necessary foundation for other bachelor-level courses. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " None, but a general knowledge of the basic concepts of law would be helpful. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The course is assessed through a written exam using the ROPOT in IS; the exam takes place in the VT classroom in the ESF premises.\n    To take the final exam, the student must have met the compulsory attendance requirement (max. three absences per semester) and obtained sufficient points through active participation during the seminars (at least 6 points).\n    Students with an ISP or an internship are given examples to complete at regular intervals instead of attending seminars. They can earn points for processing them (as an alternative to activity points).\n    To complete the course, students must obtain at least 60 points in total from the exam (max. 100 points). When achieving the minimum of 60 points, points obtained for active participation in seminars during the semester (min. 6 points) are also included in the final evaluation.\n    Caution: Any copying, recording, or leaking of the exam; use of unauthorised tools, aids, or communication devices; or other disruptions of the objectivity of exams (credit tests) will be considered noncompliance with the conditions for course completion as well as a severe violation of the scholastic rules. A student found in violation will have a grade of \u2018F\u2019 recorded in the Information System, and the Dean will initiate disciplinary proceedings that may result in suspension or expulsion. The aforementioned disciplinary procedure relates to all the activities comprising the final evaluation of the course. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " The course is taught in the form of lectures (once every 14 days) and follow-up seminars (once a week). The lectures explain the essential topics, which are further discussed in the seminars. The primary tool is the ASPI legal information system, which students will learn to navigate and use to search for legal information. Some of the seminar time is allocated to completing case studies with the help of the ASPI system: students first try to find a solution a legal issue, and then the procedure and result are explained by the teacher. ",
        "TEACHER_INFO": " ",
        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " At the end of the course, students should be able to do the following:\n    - describe the current system of law in the Czech Republic and its differences with international law, especially European Union (EU) law;\n    - explain the basic principles and institutes of law and their use in applying the law;\n    - search for and work with legal information;\n    - identify and understand the judicial branches; and\n    - understand the difference between private and public law and the disputes handled within each context.

Next basic terminology definition and explanation. In connection with the theoretical explanation, the application of selected problems follows in the form of causal and spatial analyzes, case studies. The introduction of basic statistical demographical methods is also important. 2) Seminars thematically follow in lectures. They bring a more detailed analysis to demonstrate selected processes and calculation of model exercises. Form of student teams, presentation, and discussion. The whole educational program is intertwined with the spatial, analytical-statistical and functionally-causal approach. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " Spatial planning and management refer to the methods used by the public sector to influence the future distribution of activities in spaces of various scales. It is undertaken with the aims of creating a more rational territorial organisation of land uses and the linkages between them, to balance demands for development with the need to protect the environment, and to achieve social and economic objectives. Spatial planning embraces measures to co-ordinate the spatial impacts of other sectoral policies, to achieve a more even distribution of economic development between regions than would otherwise be created by market forces, and to regulate the conversion of land and property uses. Spatial planning includes all levels of land use planning including urban planning, regional planning, national spatial plans, and in the European Union international levels. In lectures fundamental information about spatial planning in the EU and Czech Republic is supplied, its objectives and problems, its fundamental concepts and tools, together with guidance to the course literature.

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The methods of assessment are twofold. The first involves a short term paper (of approximately 1500 words length, 25% contribution to the course assessment) on an agreed topic. The aim is to develop students\u2019 understanding of planning practise at local level. The second is a written examination (a short answer format, 75% contribution to the course assessment). The examination seeks to test students\u2019 knowledge, understanding and learning competencies from the lecture and seminar series, and their ability to synthesise that knowledge and answer specific questions relating to the course material. It is necessary to gain more than 60 % of overall assessment (paper + written examination) to pass the exam. Students should attend all seminars or similar classes. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " This course is taught by a combination of lectures and seminars (2+1 hours weekly), some lectures are conducted by occasional guest speakers (professionals in the sectors). In addition, field excursions will be arranged to give students greater familiarity with the planning practise. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " AIMS\n    The Course will aim to examine the possible interaction between national, regional and a European Union identity at the economic, political and socio-cultural levels. The first part of the course will outline and examine various theories and concepts identified as useful in analysing any future construction of an economic, political and social European Union identity. In the second part of the course these will be assessed within the context of European Union \u2018core values\u2019 (democracy, the rule of law, peace and security, economic stability and prosperity, respect for human rights) and the existing \u2018identity\u2019 perspectives of EU citizens.\n\n    OBJECTIVES\n    Students will be introduced to a range of theories and concepts identified as useful in analysing any future construction of an economic, political and social European Union identity. In the second part of the course they will then be encouraged to employ these concepts in assessing the opportunities, processes and possibilities for such a construction of a citizenship EU identity.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Despite definitive debates about whether the European Union (EU) can be equated with the characteristics of a fully fledged state, it is certainly beyond the dispute that the EU has acquired for itself at least the policy making attributes of a modern state across an increasingly wide range of policy sectors. As a result it has also gained a considerable degree of power in order to set policy agendas, and formulate, implement and enforce policy decisions.\n\n    After a brief introduction to the EU institutions and the EU public policy process this course will conceptualise the EU public policy process into four sections \u2013 agenda setting, policy formulation, policy decision-making and policy implementation. In examining these four parts of the policy process different models of analysis will be employed at different levels within the EU and at different stages of the policy process.\n\n    The final section of the course will examine two EU public policy areas, utilising them as case studies within the conceptual frameworks identified in the first part of the course.

History of the public sector.\n    Economics and management of partial sectors of the public sector divided by the chronological extension of the functions of the state:\n    In the subsequent lesson, there are described the basic functions of the state which intervenes as little as possible in the economy and in life of the society, and which is called the minimal state. Here we include defense and security spending, justice and structure of public administration.\n    Than we deal with a state that we could call a state investor, which develops certain areas as an investment in further social and economic development. This area includes the development of technical infrastructure and the area of \u200b\u200beducation, science and research.\n    The relatively new function of the state is the role of the welfare state, which comes at the end of the 19th century. This category includes social security and health care areas which within a century become one of the largest spending items in public budgets.\n    In the last area, we can summarize everything the state has become more engaged in the 20th century. The regulating and subsidizing State began to influence - whether directly through subsidies or indirectly through legislation - an increasing range of activities. This area includes care for the environment, agriculture, housing, culture, physical culture and the area of \u200b\u200bchurches and religious societies. ",

The basis of the lectures is a description and explanation of the current functions of the state, its organizational structures and its management. Seminars lead to a better understanding of how the state evolved, what is current system structure and what is possible or appropriate to change. The course's students are led to realize that many of the functions that the state has taken today were originally administred outside the governmental structures by various forms of markets or non-governmental interventions, and it is relevant to ask whether it is possible to return these functions back to a private initiative. Knowledge and understanding of the current public sector system is accompanied by the consideration of potential alternatives and discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. The background is basic knowledge of individual sectors of the public sector and work with up-to-date information about its changes. At the end of the course the student should be able to: -in depth analysis of the causes of the existence of the public sector, the development of its structure -interpret the basic approaches of the different schools of economic thinking to the existence and the appropriate extent of the public sector -describe basic public sector structures and explain the basic principles of their functioning. < ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course presents an introduction to Public Economics. It deals with that part of national economy which is funded from redistributive processes and which is usually referred to as the Public Sector (PS).\n    The subject matter is divided into several interrelated blocks: The first block works more deeply with some basic concepts known to the students from Microeconomics course, mainly the econimc roles of the government. The rationale for the public sector is explored here as well. The objective is to enhance critical and analytical economic-thinking of students here.\n    The second block deals with Public Sector\u00b4s ability to reach eficient allocation of resources. Among others we study processes of resource allocation decisions making within the Public Sector - Public Choice and Public Policy analysis. The goal here is to teach students to understand the role and motivation of main players. Students should obtain knowledge of measures and tools reducing the natural tendency of PS to inefficiency in this block.\n    The third block analyses an \"anathomy\" of finantial flows within the Public Sector, it is public finance as a dominant category. The objective is to understand main principles and issues of public finances in modern economics. This block also introduces the students to the structure of public budget revenues placing special emphasis on taxes. The aim is to understand principles of \"good\" taxation and to cope with differences in attitude towards practical issues of a tax policy. ",

        "SYLLABUS": " The course content is divided into two basic blocks. The first block (more in the first half of the semester) explains the basic form of public finance and deals with the basic components of public expenditures and revenues, including the system of rules for managing public finances. The second block (especially in the second half of the semester) deals with specific aspects of public finance - particularly fiscal imbalances, and fiscal federalism. The course concludes with the issue of public control.\n\n    In the spring semester of 2023, the following structure of topics covered (lectures with seminars) is being considered:\n    1) Introduction to the study of public finance\n    2) Public expenditures\n    3) Expenditures of the social assistance and insurance systems\n    4) Financing the pension system\n    5) Budgetary system and rules\n    6) Tax policy\n    7) Reading week\n    8) Direct taxes (and their administration)\n    9) Fiscal imbalance I\n    10) Fiscal imbalance II\n    11) Fiscal federalism\n    12) Indirect taxes (and their administration)\n    13) Public control - guest lectures ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the bachelor course in public finances is particularly to:\n\n    1) Understand the basic principles of public finances. Students will gain a deeper understanding of why and how the state intervenes in selected areas of the economy and which components of the public sector are responsible for implementing public policies. At the same time, they will understand the financing of these policies, particularly the interdependence of public expenditure and revenue.\n\n    2) Master the basics of financial analysis. Students will become familiar with the basic tools of analyzing budgets and financial management of selected PA institutions. They will be able to assess their financial health based on available financial data and indicators.\n\n    3) Understand the legislative and regulatory framework. Students will become acquainted with selected legal and regulatory frameworks related to public finances, and the knowledge gained will be applicable in practice.\n\n    4) Be able to propose and argue for changes. Students will be able to propose and argue for selected changes in public policies and will be able to assess their impact on the balance of public finances (and in a broader context, assess the impact of proposed changes on other areas such as economic growth, competitiveness, environmental protection, etc.). When arguing for policy changes, they will learn to select or propose indicators to assess the impact of public policy changes.\n\n    5) Strengthen critical thinking skills. Students will be able to evaluate the conflicting goals of public policies in a balanced way. This concerns, in particular, the impact of policies on the efficiency of measures versus (social) justice or the financial impact of alternative policy settings on different social groups.\n\n    6) Improve communication and collaboration skills. Students will enhance their communication skills and ability to collaborate with other students to complete assigned tasks.\n\n    The knowledge acquired in this course creates a basic theoretical and methodological basis for understanding the subsequent subjects of bachelor's or master's studies.\" ",

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The course is concluded with an oral exam. Students are eligible to take the oral exam provided that they fulfill given conditions. Student is obliged to collect at least 60 % of points from the continuous evaluation in seminars. The continuous evaluation is based on two written tests and the elaboration and presentation of a seminar paper on a given topic. The teacher can award students with \u201cbonus\u201d points if they are active during the seminars. Not gaining the required minimum of points is considered as a failure to prepare continuously. It does not mean that students can re-take the \u201cfailed\u201d tests or the seminar paper either. Students are graded with an F in such a case.\n    Detailed information concerning the seminar paper and the tests is available in the interactive syllabi of the course in the IS MU.\n    Any copying, recording or leaking tests, use of unauthorized tools, aids and communication devices, or other disruptions of objectivity of exams (credit tests) will be considered non-compliance with the conditions for course completion as well as a severe violation of the study rules. Consequently, the teacher will finish the exam (credit test) by awarding grade \"F\" in the Information System, and the Dean will initiate disciplinary proceedings that may result in study termination. The mentioned procedure relates to all the activities that are included in the final evaluation of the course (seminar work, essays, tests etc.). ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " The course takes the form of both lectures and seminars. There are explained basic thesis of public finance topics within lectures, which are further discussed during seminars. Presentation of students' homework is a part of each seminar. Students focus on the particular issue, which they classify, evaluate and demonstrate possible solutions with usage of a practical example. In the case of a study stay abroad (Erasmus+), the following options are available (in this order): (1) Take a similar course at the host university, (2) Complete the MUNI course during the study stay, (3) Enroll in the course a year later. If you choose option (1), please contact the course guarantor before the semester begins and send her/him the syllabus of the course offered by the host university for approval of subsequent recognition. The guarantor will evaluate the course content, credit allocation, teaching methods, and assessment methods and criteria. If you choose option (2), please contact the course guarantor before the semester begins to agree on the topic of your seminar paper. After returning, you will complete a multiple-choice test and proceed to an oral exam. Details about the teaching methods can be found in the course interactive syllabi. ",

Especially for commercial enterprises, which are one of the participants in the supply chain, the functioning of logistics processes is an essential condition for their survival. With the growth of globalization and networking across the supply chain across borders, we are often talking about supply chain competitiveness. Integration can lead to improved customer service when properly and comprehensively managed, including risk-taking. The integration process supports deepening digitization as part of the new era Company 4.0. The development of information and system technologies is what promotes the efficient functioning of logistics processes, but which has an impact not only on the level of customer service but also on costs. Logistics is primarily understood as a service within the course, therefore the interpretation is based on basic theoretical concepts related to management and marketing of services.\n\n    The aim of the course is to introduce logistics and supply chain management as disciplines which have a significant impact on the competitiveness of business enterprises and value created for customers, because it crosses several business functions due to its cross-cutting nature.\n\n    The course is therefore focused on:\n    1) understanding of the importance of logistics for the competitiveness of a business and the customer value;\n    2) understanding of the logistics process and logistics decisions in the enterprise and in the supply chain in relation to their cost impact and customer service\n    3) familiarization with the technologies that are necessary for supply chain management and which are necessary in the knowledge-based and, above all, globalizing society.

        "OBJECTIVES": " In this short course, we will look at some examples of how simulating data can be a useful tool for achieving more replicable research. The size and power of statistical tests are the two parameters that tell you how much you should update your prior about the truth of a hypothesis after observing the outcome of an experiment. We will first discuss \"exact tests,\" where the size is mathematically correct, and show through simulations how tests that rely on asymptotics or unverifiable assumptions can lead to underestimating the rate of false rejections of the null. We will then use the same method to perform bespoke power analysis in a way that takes account of the actual tests you will be using and your best guess of the distributions of data you will gather. Finally, we will use simulations to investigate how poor experimental design and publication bias can lead to exaggerated statistical significance and magnitudes of treatment effects. ",

Most crucial scientific, economic, and business decisions are made based on data analysis which in its complexity can produce valuable information.\n    When dataset consists of units at which not just one but many (possibly correlated) variables are measured, Multivariate Statistical Analysis provides tools to get meaningful patterns and insights hidden behind the data. Consideration of statistical dependence among variables makes multivariate analysis somewhat different in approach and considerably more complex than the corresponding univariate analysis when there is only one response variable under consideration.\n\n\n    There are three major tasks of multivariate analysis:\n\n\n    \u2022 Reduction of multidimensionality (higher number of correlated variables can be represented by a smaller number of representative variables)\n\n\n    \u2022 Detection of outliers (with a prospect to multidimensionality which is non-intuitive)\n\n\n    \u2022 Looking for patterns and structures hidden in data\n\n\n    This course covers most of the methods used in Multivariate Statistical Analysis (see a list of topics). The aim of this course is not only to offer a theoretical background to these methods but also hands-on experience of real data processing and an interpretation of software outputs within an R environment.\n\n    ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course is designed to give students experience in using basic and advanced econometric methods important in economics, finance and other business subjects. It provides skills in regression essential for understanding much of the literature on economics, finance, and empirical studies in other business areas. Topics of introductory econometrics will be expanded to a more advanced level. Advanced econometric topics include time-series econometrics and methods, panel data models, and models with limited dependent variable models.\n    We start with regression analysis with time-series data. Careful attention is given to interpreting regression results, hypothesis testing and diagnostic tests. Further topics in regression analysis are presented, including panel data models and limited dependent variables models. By the end of the course, students should be able to use regression models in many different applications and critically examine reported regression results in empirical research in economics and other business studies. They can identify and deal with several econometric problems in analysing time series, cross-sectional and panel data. They will have experience with a range of advanced econometric tools and techniques. ",

Understanding the foreign exchange markets and global capital markets (banking, debt and equity) is necessary to carry out a sound and effective management of the multinational firm from a financial point of view.

Currency reports mainly analyze and forecast exchange rates and are routinely prepared and distributed by investment banks to clients worldwide. The investment opportunities report usually contains detailed suggestions on portfolio allocation per financial instrument in a specific country alongside possible risk management solutions. The suggestions should be reasonable and justified. Students should use qualitative and quantitative methods to support conclusions in report based on the data from the Thomson Reuters Terminal.\n\n    Following is the scale that will be used to evaluate your performance in this class:\n    - Homework up to 10-grade points\n    - Currency Report up to 20-grade points\n    - Final exam (up to 70-grade points, minimum 50% required). The exam will be cumulative on the material from the entire course.\n\n    -active participation in the class, extra 10 points available.\n\n    Students cannot take an exam without submitting homework and Currency report with all the requirements fulfilled. Active participation in class means that the student is actively watching, listening, and answering questions as the lecture progresses. A student also tries to solve the suggested example problems as the lecture proceeds and proves that he/she has learned the material by answering the related questions and working on the related problems. Participation quality (thoughtfulness of comments or questions) is valued more than participation quantity (frequency of comments/ questions).

Currency reports mainly analyze and forecast exchange rates and are routinely prepared and distributed by investment banks to clients worldwide. The investment opportunities report usually contains detailed suggestions on portfolio allocation per financial instrument in a specific country alongside possible risk management solutions. The suggestions should be reasonable and justified. Students should use qualitative and quantitative methods to support conclusions in report based on the data from the Thomson Reuters Terminal.\n\n    Following is the scale that will be used to evaluate your performance in this class:\n    - Homework up to 10-grade points\n    - Currency Report up to 20-grade points\n    - Final exam (up to 70-grade points, minimum 50% required). The exam will be cumulative on the material from the entire course.\n\n    -active participation in the class, extra 10 points available.\n\n    Students cannot take an exam without submitting homework and a Currency report with all the requirements fulfilled. Active participation in class means that the student is actively watching, listening, and answering questions as the lecture progresses. A student also tries to solve the suggested example problems as the lecture proceeds and proves that he/she has learned the material by answering the related questions and working on the related problems. Participation quality (thoughtfulness of comments or questions) is valued more than participation quantity (frequency of comments/ questions). In the event of student's departure abroad, the student is obliged to contact the teacher before departure and agree on the dates for fulfilling the stated conditions. ",

Students are required to demonstrate whether there are relevant data and information sources to achieve the proposed objectives of theses and whether those sources are at their disposal. If a topic is to include the application part, the student is required to research the data sources, and if necessary to contact practitioners to demonstrate their willingness to cooperate (if necessary) and to identify specific sources for an application part. If this condition is not satisfied, it is not possible to set the supervisor approve to the assignment. No later than at the beginning of the examination period, all this must be agreed between the student and supervisor of theses. Then the supervisor must entry the agreed assignment into the IS by the end of the second week of the examination period. Based on an embedded assignment in IS student will then be awarded by credit by the supervisor confirming that he agrees with the assignment of theses. The above information suggests primarily student, supervisor performs technical supervision and possibly corrects subject, aim, methods, procedures and literature.

        "OBJECTIVES": " This course will present the symbiosis between the principles of operations management (OR) and the tools, that are used to control processes. Classic operations research courses are often devoted to methods and solving problems associated with processes. On the other hand, in courses that discuss sophisticated software tools such as the ERP or CRM, students will learn how to use this or that function or how these systems are configured. This information is without a doubt very useful, especially for IT managers. Still, it is utterly insufficient for standard users who need to know how structured data provided by the software can be used for improvements of existing processes. This course integrates ERP and the management of operations from the perspective of the ERP system, Microsoft 365 Business Central. Operations may be interpreted as a set of functions or parts of systems transferring inputs into outputs of handy value while taking into consideration, that basic principles of operational proceedings are based on feedback and requirements. The operational horizons addressed in the course are divided into four sectors: Finance and Accounting (production and inventory data and analysis of related costs, basic reporting, budgets and capacities) Suppliers (orders for material replenishment, quality management, material availability) Marketing (product availability, lead time estimates, business opportunities, dispatching, sales forecasts, customer feedback). ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The subject is related to the knowledge acquired in the preceding courses, particularly the ones based on computer science and economics such as Introduction to Computer Science and Information Technologies, Accounting, logistics, chosen decision making tools or subjects related to Company Management and Enterprise Processes. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " For the standard full-time study, the course will be split into13 blocks of lectures, and every block will be 2 + 2 hours. The first two teaching units will be dedicated to theory sessions (see syllabus) and the subsequent two teaching units to hands-on, where students will be working with ERP system MS 365 Business Central The subject is not provided for combined or other forms of study except for full-time study. The complex character of the item requires that course switches from lectures to hands-on procedures and vice versa, so the attendance is mandatory for all lectures and seminars !! In every lesson, the teacher will require a discussion about the subject and will present real case studies from his expertise for a better understanding of the usage of managerial methods and tools. Students will be supplied with the latest available demo version of an ERP system MS Dynamics NAV, and it is expected that this demo version will be installed on their private computers to check acquired skills during self-study. The teacher will continuously review the student's ability to operate the demo version of ERP during seminars. The first part of the final exam will consist of a written section, in which the student will prepare a basis for the subsequent oral exam about managerial methods and the second hands-on part where the student will present a required example of a daily process in ERP. The question will be supplied in advance and will be stored on the university server. The manuals and PowerPoint presentations related to every provided chapter will be stored on that server as well as the written materials, which will help to model required processes in the ERP system. Students will write one seminar works based on instructions provided by the lecturer. Without evaluated seminar work, students will not be accepted for final exams !!! Any copying, keeping a record of tests, or carrying the checks out, using forbidden aids including any communication devices or any other breach of objectivity of the exam, is regarded as a failure to meet the obligations of the subject and as a serious breach of study regulations. As a consequence, the teacher grades the student with \"F\" and the dean is allowed to initiate disciplinary action, which might lead to the termination of the studies. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Lectures and seminars, modeling the typical case studies by using the chosen ERP system and related discussions, self-study, hands-on ERP systems. During theoretical sessions, a subject will be presented by the use of power-point presentations handed over to study materials. If necessary, all examples will be also shown in an ERP system or MS Office application (such as Excel). Most of the examples are connected to teacher experiences (freelanced consultancy related to the implementation of ERP systems). During the seminars, every student will have at his/her disposal own demo version of the ERP system in order to practice. For the home study, free access to the network version of the system will be provided. ",
        "TEACHER_INFO": " Important comment : Practical knowledge of the basics of one of the most extensive information system Microsoft 365 Business Central in the world is a considerable advantage for students when looking for careers in the future. This knowledge students acquire during the course. ",
        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " The student will be able to:\n    - understand the reasons for using modern ERP systems;\n    - use of methods of operation management to find constraints in processes and to suggest optimal solution for the customer to diminish bottleneck influence ;\n    - understood symbiosis between the principles of operations research (OR) and the tools, that are used to control processes such as ERP and BI ;\n    - understanding how the synergy of OR methods and ERP systems cab bus used in management;\n    - define the benefits of using ERP systems;\n    - use of methods of operation management to make optimal decisions; ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " Management consulting is a sector where some graduates of economic schools are heading. It offers diverse work, potential for personal and qualification growth, but on the other hand not everyone can become a consultant. The course does not primarily aim to develop existing knowledge of the business process (Doctrines of enterprise, Management, Economics of orgaizations, etc.), but is aimed at developing the student's ability to arrange the consulting process, to acquire and work with data and to present facts to support the final strategic decisions to the client. For the development of the consultant's personality, the courses Project Management, Innovation Management are beneficial for learning creative methods in finding solutions, or Controlling, where students work with sotwars for presenting and reporting data (Power BI).\n\n    The aim of the course (from the student's point of view) is to create a picture of the possible work in consulting practice including major decisions, to master the consulting process from building a relationship with clients to presenting solutions, to spread a positive attitude towards consulting in corporate practice.\n\n    In the course we aim (from the teacher's perspective) to facilitate students' entry, decision-making and actual operation in the consulting market, which has its own specificities, either as a consultant or as a client requesting consulting services.

This is a total of 25 points that a student can earn.\n\n    D) Points for mini-tests on material covered in lecture blocks (12 points)\n    This will be three mini tests (max 4 questions in each) that the student has the opportunity to answer online within a week of the lecture. It will test the necessary knowledge of the counselor that will be covered in the lecture and students will be reminded of it - ethical principles, what MECE means, BATNA, etc. Students must earn 70% of the total points (8 out of 12).

As part of the lectures, key ideas will be presented in the form of group discussions combined with a lecture by the instructor.

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course offers a wider perspective of the issue of real estate valuation. It is based on thorough understanding of the principles of the real estate market and its specifics; attention is devoted to the public interest, land use planning and real estate register. The significance of and the reasons for real estate valuation are explained in the practice. Their importance for tourism plays an important role in terms of access to real estate. The actual valuation starts with clarifying the procedures for land value determination (either using price maps of building sites or using calculation) and fruit trees and decorative plants value determination. Further attention is given to the cost, comparison and profit approach to building and flat valuations. All procedures are illustrated using practical examples, which enables the right interpretation of the found prices in dependence on the methods used. Special emphasis is placed on the correct pricing of holiday cottages and other buildings representing the tourism infrastructure, as well as the specific impact of their location in protected areas, spas and other important tourist sites. The entire course works with the idea of spatial differentiation of property values and also with the dimension of the attractiveness of real estate for tourism. ",

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " 90-minute seminars take place every two weeks of the term. Students will elaborate a research proposal on the selected topic. At the end, there is a written examination and an oral discussion of the elaborated research proposal. The written exam has 2 parts: 1st part checks the knowledge of the theory presented in the lectures (50%); 2nd part checks the ability to apply the theory to practical examples (50%). The quality of the research proposal will be evaluated using the 0-10 scale. The final evaluation will be based on the above-mentioned scores. The minimum for passing the exam is 60%.\n    If a student enrolls in the course during studying abroad through exchange programs (such as Erasmus), they should contact the course garantor. In such case, the student has two options: (1) take a similar course at a foreign university or (2) take the course later, after returning from their study abroad program.\n    If a student is found to commit a prohibited act, such as using banned tools, cheating, or removing any part of the exam, the teacher is allowed to interrupt the exam and grade the student with F, FF or FFF, depending on the seriousness of the offence. The mentioned policy applies to all activities that are part of the final evaluation of the course, such as seminar work, essays, tests etc.). ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the master degree course in public finances is particularly to:\n\n    1) Understand the basic principles of public finances. Students will gain a deeper understanding of why and how the state intervenes in selected areas of the economy and which components of the public sector are responsible for implementing public policies. At the same time, they will understand the financing of these policies, particularly the interdependence of public expenditure and revenue.\n\n    2) Master the basics of financial analysis. Students will become familiar with the basic tools of analyzing budgets and financial management of selected PA institutions. They will be able to assess their financial health based on available financial data and indicators.\n\n    3) Understand the legislative and regulatory framework. Students will become acquainted with selected legal and regulatory frameworks related to public finances, and the knowledge gained will be applicable in practice.\n\n    4) Be able to propose and argue for changes. Students will be able to propose and argue for selected changes in public policies and will be able to assess their impact on the balance of public finances (and in a broader context, assess the impact of proposed changes on other areas such as economic growth, competitiveness, environmental protection, etc.).

Student is obliged to collect at least 60 % of points from the continuous evaluation in seminars. The continuous evaluation is based on two written tests and the elaboration and presentation of a seminar paper on a given topic. The teacher can award students with \u201cbonus\u201d points if they are active during the seminars. Not gaining the required minimum of points is considered as a failure to prepare continuously. It does not mean that students can re-take the \u201cfailed\u201d tests or the seminar paper either. Students are graded with an F in such a case.\n    Detailed information concerning the seminar paper and the tests is available in the interactive syllabi of the course in the IS MU.\n    Any copying, recording or leaking tests, use of unauthorized tools, aids and communication devices, or other disruptions of objectivity of exams (credit tests) will be considered non-compliance with the conditions for course completion as well as a severe violation of the study rules. Consequently, the teacher will finish the exam (credit test) by awarding grade \"F\" in the Information System, and the Dean will initiate disciplinary proceedings that may result in study termination. The mentioned procedure relates to all the activities that are included in the final evaluation of the course (seminar work, essays, tests etc.). ",
