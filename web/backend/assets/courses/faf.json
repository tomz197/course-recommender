    "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the course is to introduce the general university public to the view of the drug as its own effective molecule and to acquaint students with the path that leads to the discovery of the drug and its introduction into medical practice. From the perspective of historical development, current state and future perspectives, the course describes the sources of biologically active molecules and how these original \"lead compounds\" can be improved and optimized so that they can serve as effective and safe drugs for the present and future. It also focuses on the difference between \"small molecules\", ie classic \"chemical\" drugs, and \"large\" molecules, so-called bio-drugs, whose importance in the treatment of serious diseases has increased significantly in recent decades. The course also describes the role of chemical, biological, mathematical, physical, computer, and other disciplines in drug development, and mentions, among other things, the use of computer modeling of potentially effective molecules and their interactions with the target structure, such as receptor or enzyme active site in virtual space. The intended \"side effect\" of the course is also to increase the visibility of the Faculty of Pharmacy among Faculties of MU, and also the reputation of pharmacy as a profession in society. ",

    "OBJECTIVES": " Biotherapeutics (\"or biological and biotechnological substances\" in WHO terms) are medicines with a relative molecular mass in most greater than 1 000 (in contrast to classical \"chemical\" medicines called \"small molecules\"). They are usually produced in other ways than by common chemical synthesis (recombinant technologies are typical). They mostly have neither exactly defined chemical structure nor exactly known relative molecular mass because they are often mixtures of structurally related biopolymers. They frequently exhibit primary structure (monomers' sequence, eg. that of amino acids, nucleotides, or monosaccharides) and secondary, tertiary, and quarternary one. This group includes eg. monoclonal antibodies, modified receptor molecules, protein and peptide hormones, cytokines, hematopoietic factors, modified oligonucleotides, vaccines of all generations, and heparins. Biologic therapy grows rapidly during the past decades and is often considered to be the last chance in the treatment of cancer or autoimmune diseases. The wider usage of biotherapeutics is still slowed down by their high price. This problem is, however, being a step wisely overcome by the introduction of biosimilar products which mean an analogy of generics in terms of small molecules. ",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Medicinal Chemistry (MC) is a discipline dealing mainly with relationships between chemical structure and therapeutic activity of medicines which are mostly organic but also inorganic molecules. That is why it observes the impact of physico-chemical properties, space arrangement and further structure features on the activity of a drug. It concerns in detail with mechanisms of drug intearactions with target structures such as receptors\u00b4 or enzyme active sites. As a scientific discipline, MC participates importantly in the drug design and development process. As a specific discipline of the pharmacetical study, MC is one of five stem subjects in which students do the state final exam. Here, MC can be divided into general and special parts. General MC presents general aspects of structure-activity relationships, both qulitative and quantitative, as well as common principles of derivation and proposal of structures of new medicines (analogy, homology, isomerism, isosterism...). Systematic MC deals then with the particular therapeutic groups of drugs respecting the system used in pharmacology. Here, it brings a comprehensive overwiev of fundamental structural types and tries to grasp main structure-activity relationships within each group. It also reports syntheses and methabolic pathways of some representatives of these groups. Simply said, MC builds some type of bridge between fundamental chemical disciplines, represented mainly by organic chemistry, and pharmacology.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Medicinal Chemistry (MC) is a discipline dealing mainly with relationships between chemical structure and therapeutic activity of medicines which are mostly organic but also inorganic molecules. That is why it observes the impact of physico-chemical properties, space arrangement and further structure features on the activity of a drug. It concerns in detail with mechanisms of drug intearactions with target structures such as receptors\u00b4 or enzyme active sites. As a scientific discipline, MC participates importantly in the drug design and development process. As a specific discipline of the pharmacetical study, MC is one of five stem subjects in which students do the state final exam. Here, MC can be divided into general and special parts. General MC presents general aspects of structure-activity relationships, both qulitative and quantitative, as well as common principles of derivation and proposal of structures of new medicines (analogy, homology, isomerism, isosterism...). Systematic MC deals then with the particular therapeutic groups of drugs respecting the system used in pharmacology. Here, it brings a comprehensive overwiev of fundamental structural types and tries to grasp main structure-activity relationships within each group. It also reports syntheses and methabolic pathways of some representatives of these groups. Simply said, MC builds some type of bridge between fundamental chemical disciplines, represented mainly by organic chemistry, and pharmacology.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Biomacromolecules exhibiting primary, secondary, tertiary and even quarternary structures belong among the most important parts of living organisms. Their importance for the therapy of various diseases is also crucial. Proteins, in particular receptor molecules and enzymes are therapetic targets. Some enzymes and modified receptor molecules can be, however, found among medicines as well as protein and peptide hormones, cytokines, haematopoietic factors. Last, but not least members of this series are antibodies. These are mainly therapeutic monoclonal antibodies known as mabs. Also nucleic acids, various DNA and RNA types, can be therapeutic targets, although much more frequently is the role of therapeutic targets for small molecule medicines played by enzymes taking part in their synthesis or post-synthetic modifications. Shorter or longer molecules of less or more modified nucleic acids, namely antisense oligonucleotides and DNA vaccines, can also act as therapeutics. Polysaccharides, the third important group of biogenic macromolecules,, represent also therapeutic targets, however, drugs of this type are of much greater importance (e.g. heparines, chondroitine). The advanced discipline intended for Ph.D. students is just focused on biologic macromolecules both native and modified and their interactions with low molecular drugs and other biopolymers.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "A specific drug molecule is in the spotlight of this discipline. The advanced course proceeds the general Medicinal Chemistry and develops it towards research and development of medicines on molecular level. The discipline sums up different approaches and protocols either typical only for Medicinal Chemistry (priviledged structures\u00b4 concept, drug likeness, pharmacogenomics, fragment method, molecular docking etc.) or adapted from other more general disciplines (QSAR including physico-chemical descriptors used there, combinatorial chemistry). The discipline touches also methods of the acitity assessment of biologicaly active compounds in vitro, some pharmacokinetic systems (efflux pumps) and specifity of development of veterinary drugs. The development in some model therapeutic groups is here described in more detail (strong analgesics as an example of small moleculs, haematopoietic factors as an example of biologic therapeutics).",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Biomacromolecules exhibiting primary, secondary, tertiary and even quarternary structures belong among the most important parts of living organisms. Their importance for the therapy of various diseases is also crucial. Proteins, in particular receptor molecules and enzymes are therapetic targets. Some enzymes and modified receptor molecules can be, however, found among medicines as well as protein and peptide hormones, cytokines, haematopoietic factors. Last, but not least members of this series are antibodies. These are mainly therapeutic monoclonal antibodies known as mabs. Also nucleic acids, various DNA and RNA types, can be therapeutic targets, although much more frequently is the role of therapeutic targets for small molecule medicines played by enzymes taking part in their synthesis or post-synthetic modifications. Shorter or longer molecules of less or more modified nucleic acids, namely antisense oligonucleotides and DNA vaccines, can also act as therapeutics. Polysaccharides, the third important group of biogenic macromolecules,, represent also therapeutic targets, however, drugs of this type are of much greater importance (e.g. heparines, chondroitine). The advanced discipline intended for Ph.D. students is just focused on biologic macromolecules both native and modified and their interactions with low molecular drugs and other biopolymers.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes (changes) which condition and accompany life in its most varied forms and manifestations, and attemps to explain its essence on a molecular level. Medical biochemistry is biochemistry in use, applied quite specifically in veterinary medicine (for example, the peculiarities of the metabolism of nutrients in invidual species of livestock). Further, in teaching of biochemistry, it is necessary to concentrate on detailed interpretation of selected chapters, that are most significant for the formation of the European profile of a graduate of veterinary university. Practical (laboratory) work where verbal information is confirmed by practical experience is also an integral component of the biochemistry teaching.\n\n   ",

To pass the course successfully, you must pass the test at 60%. The prerequisite for passing the exam is passing all practical exercises, passing the test from the exercises with 80%, adequate knowledge of biochemical issues and correct preparation of all exercise protocols. At the same time, a short task readiness test will be conducted before each exercise. During the course of study, it is mandatory to complete 4 tests from basic biochemical pathways. Furthermore, the group task of developing 2 chapters of seminars on Biochemistry (Josef Tomandl, Eva T\u00e1borsk\u00e1 and the team. Biochemistry I : seminars. Brno, 2012. ISBN 978-80-210-5740-1).

    "SYLLABUS": "Content of the discipline expressed as topics of lectures:\n    Biological therapeutics (biologics) and conventional small molecule drugs - definition, history, contemporary situation, classification of biologics, fundamentals of their terminology. (Farsa)\n    Immunopeparations. Vaccines of both traditional and novel type. (assoc. prof.Ale\u0161 Franc from Department of Pharmaceutical Technology)\n    Drugs with peptide structure (except for enzymes and antibodies). (Farsa)\n    Antisense oligonucleotides. Poly- and oligosacharides as drugs. (Farsa)\n    Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. (Farsa)\n    Modified receptor molecules and transmembrane proteins as medicines.(Farsa)\n    Enzymes as drugs. (Farsa)\n   ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " Biotherapeutics (\"or biological and biotechnological substances\" in WHO terms) are medicines with relative molecular mass in most greater than 1 000 (in contrast to classical \"chemical\" medicines called \"small molecules\"). They are usually produced by other way than by a common chemical synthesis (recombinant technologies are typical). They mostly have neither exactly defined chemical structure nor exactly known relative molecular mass because they are often mixtures of structurally related biopolymers. They frequently exhibit primary structure (monomeres' sequence, eg. that of amino acids, nucleotides or monosaccharides) and secondary, tertiary and quarternary one. This group includes eg. monoclonal antibodies, modified receptor molecules, protein and peptide hormones, cytokines, haematopoietic factors, modified oligonucleotides, vaccines of all generations and heparines. Biologic therapy grows rapidly during past decades and is often considered to be the last chance in treatment of cancer or autoimune diseases. The wider usage of biotherapeutics is still slowed down by their high price. This problem is, however, beeing stepwisely overcome by introduction of biosimilar products which mean an analogy of generics in terms of small molecules. ",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Medicinal Chemistry (MC) is a discipline dealing mainly with relationships between chemical structure and therapeutic activity of medicines which are mostly organic but also inorganic molecules. That is why it observes the impact of physico-chemical properties, space arrangement and further structure features on the activity of a drug. It concerns in detail with mechanisms of drug intearactions with target structures such as receptors\u00b4 or enzyme active sites. As a scientific discipline, MC participates importantly in the drug design and development process. As a specific discipline of the pharmacetical study, MC is one of five stem subjects in which students do the state final exam. Here, MC can be divided into general and special parts. General MC presents general aspects of structure-activity relationships, both qulitative and quantitative, as well as common principles of derivation and proposal of structures of new medicines (analogy, homology, isomerism, isosterism...). Systematic MC deals then with the particular therapeutic groups of drugs respecting the system used in pharmacology. Here, it brings a comprehensive overwiev of fundamental structural types and tries to grasp main structure-activity relationships within each group. It also reports syntheses and methabolic pathways of some representatives of these groups. Simply said, MC builds some type of bridge between fundamental chemical disciplines, represented mainly by organic chemistry, and pharmacology.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "Pathology and pathophysiology can be defined as the science of the functions of a diseased organism, at the level of cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. In this course, students will learn about the skin as an organ that provides one of the most important barriers of the human organism, which simultaneously fulfills metabolic, detoxification, resorption and excretory functions. In addition to the basic physiological functions of the skin and skin adnexa, the main skin pathophysiological processes will be discussed, which will be the basis for understanding skin diseases. Other processes that have their skin manifestations will also be mentioned, such as infectious diseases, systemic diseases of the connective tissue and others. Attention will also be paid to damage to the skin by various influences. The course will be focused on a comprehensive understanding of the skin as a necessary system ensuring the integrity of the organism, as well as the important routes of drugs and toxic substances into the organism. Lectures will be supplemented by seminars in which case studies will be presented",
