In this course, we will introduce multilingual minds from the perspective of psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics and highlight the possible advantages and disadvantages of multilingualism. We will also take a look at multilingual speakers from the perspective of European language policy and show how this perspective affects language learning. In this course you will develop your linguistic and socio-cultural competences. You will learn how to develop the skills to express your own ideas, beliefs and needs with respect for other people, how to react in a conflict or uncomfortable situation, how to prevent provocation or manipulative techniques in communication and, last but not least, how to calmly defend your own boundaries. The course consists of two parts and involves working on assertiveness not only from a psychological point of view, but also in terms of language clich\u00e9s, which also increases confidence in communication.",

    "OBJECTIVES": "In this e-learning course, we aimed to address the challenges posed by communication with preschool-aged child patients. Students of Czech as a foreign language may encounter communication with child patients only sporadically in commonly used Czech textbooks. Therefore, we visited general practitioners' offices and we developed specialized exercised based on audio recordings or authentic linguistic material. We emphasized the differences between communication with adults and communication with children and highlighted typical features of children's speech in the preschool age group. Although a significant part of the communication occurs between healthcare personnel (doctor and nurse) and the crucial role is played by nonverbal communication and sociocultural factors, we believe this e-learning course will be useful for medical faculty students.",

These topics are covered in individual blocks of the respective interactive curriculum - each teacher works with one curriculum. The topics of both curricula are interlinked and closely interrelated. In the course, students are introduced to the overall concept of wellbeing and its basic principles, as well as techniques that lead to a change of mindset, a sense of inner well-being and a life balance. These include techniques such as art therapy, psychohygiene, relaxation and stress management in different situations, with an emphasis on language and communication barriers.",

The common denominator of research in the 21st century across disciplines is research data, which is the cornerstone of scientific work in different disciplines. Scientific data is now coming to the fore in terms of applicability, communication and credibility of the research. However, the view of, access to, and principles for working with scientific data vary greatly depending on the scientific discipline.\n    You can look forward to lectures by successful MU researchers across research disciplines who will introduce you to practical research issues and the use of data in their research. You will be able to compare what research practice entails in your home faculty's disciplines and how researchers in other fields approach research and work with data. Understanding their ways of thinking and needs will allow you to better understand the world and research outside of your domain.

The tasks for both the text and the audio/video recordings allow practice in different aspects of linguistic competence such as grammar, syntax, stylistics, vocabulary and comprehension. Individual exercises are divided into these categories, allowing students to focus on a particular area according to their preferences. Thus, they can work only with exercises focused on grammar or, conversely, only on vocabulary development, allowing for targeted and effective learning. In total, there are 13 topics (units) in the e-learning. There are 6 topics in the natural sciences and engineering, and 7 topics in the human sciences. Each topic is divided into 3 ROPOTs according to content (most often vocabulary, comprehension and grammar). The only exception is Dr. Kaku and reviews, this topic is divided into 5 ROPOTs for better clarity. Human Sciences - Formative assessment - The Gender Dimension of Science, Size Matters - Irregular verbs - Reducing linguistic diversity affects our perception of the world - Differences in boys' and girls' mathematical and reading literacy and early selection: trends in both countries after the division of Czechoslovakia - Linguistic diversity and the causes of its threat in the 21st century - Assessment and evaluation in the educational process Natural and Engineering Sciences - CO2 - Artificial intelligence and programming - Dr. Kaku and reviews - Physics - Is it possible to make a Jedi lightsaber in real life? - Information Technology",

This will allow the students to assess the past-present linkages and their relevance today (as in how the communist past still plays a significant role in this part of Europe and why this is so). Hence, the course will enable the students to fully understand not only the historical perspective of the given region but also the major political and societal issues that Central and Eastern Europe has been facing in contemporary times. Last of all, the course program has one field/study trip planned (most likely a local one), providing the students with the possibility to experience the communist past for themselves and see the way it has come to define the present (in this case of one of the CEE countries, the Czech Republic).",

These readings, listed in separate folders according to the names of the lectures, will be made available to the students a week before the start of the course. The number of pages to be read per week shall be, at most, 38. *Final exam: 40 points The exam consists of 5 open questions requiring longer answers (2-3 paragraphs on each question). Students will be asked to prove that they have acquired enough knowledge about the topics covered throughout the course, showing that they can critically discuss the dynamics in the region from historical and theoretical points of view. *Presentations on the selected topics (to be uploaded by the students to the respective IS folder before the presentation): 30 points Each presentation will be about 20min long, consisting of a short summary/background to the given topic, critical analysis of the problem at hand, and questions for the in-class discussion. The following topics/seminars are to be chosen by the students when presenting: 5, 7, and 10. The students are to choose a controversial politician, a populist political platform, and/or an anti-European political movement/party from either Central Europe or the Balkans, present on his/her/their political career/influence and discuss their political relevance concerning the post-socialist development of both regions, paying particular attention to the specificities of these regions. It is expected that the max number of students per group shall not exceed 4. The students will have applied for the topics/groups of their choice by October 10 (reporting directly to Dr. Taterov\u00e1).

The programme is designed to be interactive, introducing participants to Brno through literature, music, art, film, etc. Although the basic topics related to our society and the city of Brno are usually included in regular language courses, the concept of the courses does not usually allow for more space to be devoted to these topics. The experiential form, which forms the backbone of the course, allows, thanks to its character, to go beyond the merely informative framework in presenting our culture and society, and thanks to the experience it allows participants to better understand certain specifics of Czech society. In this way, participants will be able to gain a more comprehensive picture of the city in which they live, study or work, which forms the basis for easier and more natural integration into life in Czech society. The emphasis is on autonomous learning. Gamification elements are included to diversify the activities. The target group includes foreign students and foreign MU employees.",
