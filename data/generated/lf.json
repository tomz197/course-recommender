Then, the focus will be on the initial approach to the patient using the ABCDE algorithm. You will have the opportunity to experience this procedure in our simulators.\n    1st TUESDAY (SIMU): On the second day of the practice, you will train some technical skills focused on the airway. This exercise will also include a discussion of the various forms of oxygenotherapy. The lesson ends with two simulations where you will review the knowledge and skills you have acquired.\n    1st WEDNESDAY (SIMU): The third day of the exercise focuses on performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After practising safe defibrillation, you will repeatedly perform basic and advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation on adult and pediatric simulators.\n    1st THURSDAY 1 (ARK): On Thursday, in the ARK department, you will learn the basic steps in the diagnosis and treatment of some arrhythmias, both tachy and bradyarrhythmias. In addition, you will discuss the cardiogenic shock issue and visit the ARK department's clinical facilities. This teaching will occur at the ARK department of St. Anne's Hospital.\n    1st FRIDAY (SIMU): In this lesson, you will learn about distribution shock, sepsis and septic shock in the SIMU. The teaching of this lesson consists of a discussion and two high-fidelity simulations.\n    2nd MONDAY (SIMU): In this lesson, you will look into the SIMU - Emergency Room (Ground Floor of SIMU), where we will focus on the topic of hypovolemic shock, as well as the topic of Trauma and the polytraumatized patient. The lesson will also include team communication and cooperation training during patient transport.\n    2nd TUESDAY (SIMU): In this practice, you will learn about the topics of obstructive shock by discussion and then review the ABCDE approach and cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a focus on complications in the A, B, and C issues that have been discussed so far in the Intensive Care Medicine practice.\n    2nd WEDNESDAY (KARIM): In this session, you will perform an orientation neurological examination on actual patients in a real intensive care setting, and the topics of seizures and glycemic disorders will be discussed in the KARIM library using commented case studies. This teaching will take place at KARIM University Hospital Brno-Bohunice.\n    2nd THURSDAY (KDAR): In the pre-last exercise, you will discuss the topic of Acid-Base Balance, Disorders of Kalaemia, Intoxications, and Indications of Renal Replacement Therapy. This teaching will take place at the KDAR University Hospital Brno - Children's Hospital Brno.\n    2nd FRIDAY (SIMU): In the last exercise, you will again solve various high-fidelity simulations in the SIMU, which will test what you have already learned. Within these simulations, you will encounter several life-threatening situations that await your solution. ",

Practical training in faculty hospitals (about 20 % of the total volume of teaching) is complemented by a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on simulators with varying degrees of fidelity, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation results in subsequent debriefing (feedback to the student). There is also problem-oriented learning in the foreground, where the student is taught by solving the problem presented, as well as team-oriented teaching when small groups of students discuss and choose a solution to the problem. Emphasis is also placed on the development of soft skills, incl. so-called \"21st-century skills\", particularly communication, decision-making skills, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork.

A student that is not successful at any of the parts does not continue to other parts. The exception is a student coming to his/her last resit. Such student always absolves all three parts, and a co-examiner is present at the third part.\n    (1) Written admission test consists of 20 questions, mostly \"single best answer\" type, partially also filling in missing word or other type questions. Students having at least 14 correct answers are considered having successfully done this part. Students coming to a resit term and having the test successfully completed in one of previous attempts do not have to redo the test again.\n    (2) Practical examination means doing a task picked by a student, or given to him by a teacher. Students coming for a resit term do not have to absolve the practical part repeatedly if they have got value \"A\" or \"B\" at one of previous attempts. Elaborating of a written protocol from the practical part may be requested.\n    (3) Theoretical part means that student picks one question for each of three groups of questions. The total number of questions is approximately 180. The student elaborates the questions in written form, signs them and gives them to the teacher. The teacher asks additional questions to them orally. After that, the student is evaluated.\n    Warning 1: At any part of the exam the student may be told to show his/her protocols from practical sessions. The quality of the protocols may be taken into account at the final evaluation.\n    Warning 2: Skipping the test and/or the practical part cannot be done in case of students coming again for their regular exam term in a repeatedly registered subject.\n    Note: Student that failed at part (1) and (2) and feel disadvantaged may appeal to the head-examiner during next 60 minutes.

    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The evaluation consists of several components. In Clinical introduction III, you need to complete attendance requirements in internal medicine and surgery clinics, pass a practical OSCE exam and a theoretical exam.\n    All the details of the OSCE exam are placed in the interactive course syllabus and the student is obliged to get acquainted with them. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " Practicals always have a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is devoted to the above-mentioned topic, practical (for which the main emphasis is placed) \u2013 at the patient (taking of personal and medical history, examination of individual organs), basic examination methods (ultrasound, X-ray, laboratory findings, ECG). Practical training (about 50 % of the total volume of teaching) is complemented by a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on simulators with varying degrees of fidelity, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation results in subsequent debriefing (feedback to the student). There is also problem-oriented learning in the foreground, where the student is taught by solving the problem presented, as well as team-oriented teaching when small groups of students discuss and choose a solution to the problem. Emphasis is also placed on the development of soft skills, incl. so-called \"21st-century skills\", particularly communication, decision-making skills, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork.

    "OBJECTIVES": " Greek-Latin medical terminology is one of the relevant means for acquisition of the target knowledge of medical students. The tuition is of both theoretic and practical character, conceived as a preparatory course sui generis, introducing the students into the study of medicine by means of its language.\n    The content of tuition is, like the set of knowledge postulated in the examination, exclusively determined by the needs of the discipline and medical practice. In the first place it provides such knowledge of Latin and/or Greek as enables the student to master quickly and purposefully the semantic aspect of terms, their grammatical form, and word-forming structure. Simultaneously, it provides a systematic instruction to independent solution of current terminological problems consisting in understanding of the technical content of the terms and in the formation of medical terms. Besides, it opens a view of the wider historical and linguistic fundamentals of medical terminology as well as its general theoretical contexts. ",

This approach will increase the information yield of each teaching topic, ensure that they are more readable, and increase the scope for clinical and practical skills practice within the teaching (but will not be systematically monitored). Knowledge of the information presented in this interactive syllabus is, of course, highly recommended for exam purposes. ",

    "TEACHING_METHODS": " Practical training + workshops: Practical teaching is provided by the inpatient and outpatient parts of the neurology department (including the neurological intensive care unit and stroke unit) and specialised laboratories (ultrasound, clinical neurophysiology, i.e. EMG, EEG, evoked potentials), combined with a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on different fidelity simulators, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation is followed by debriefing (feedback to the student). Learning is problem-based (students learn by solving the problem presented) and team-based (small groups of students discuss and choose a solution to the problem). Special emphasis is placed on developing soft skills, including the so-called \"21st Century Skills\", in particular communication, decision-making, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork. ",
    "TEACHER_INFO": " The course takes place in one of the following neurological clinics according to the timetable:\n    - Neurological Clinic of the University Hospital in Brno (FN Brno)\n\n\n    - 1st Clinic of Neurology, St. Anne's University Hospital (FN USA)\n\n\n    - Paediatric Neurology Clinic (FDN)\n\n\n    The course starts every day at 8 am and ends at 1 pm. At the beginning of the first day of the course, students report to the secretariat of the respective department:\n\n\n    - NK FN Brno, Jihlavsk\u00e1 20, 12th floor of the main building (L), Mrs. Sal\u00e1kov\u00e1 (53223 2503)\n\n\n    - NK FN USA, Peka\u0159sk\u00e1 53, building C1, 6th floor, Mrs Aberlov\u00e1 (54318 2658)\n\n\n    - KDN, \u010cernopoln\u00ed 9, building G, 4th floor, Mrs Chalupov\u00e1 (53223 4919)\n\n\n    Students should bring their own white coats and neurological hammers. Neurological hammers are available in the medical bookshop in building A9, Bohunice campus (Kamenice 753/5, tel. 54949 3619). Students attending courses at NK FN Brno can borrow a hammer from the secretary's office against a signature.\n\n\n    The course requires basic knowledge of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (motor pathway: pyramidal tracts, cerebellum, basal ganglia, sensory pathway, thalamus, visual pathway, cranial nerves, neurotransmitters). Before the start of each course, the selected pre-study material available in the interactive syllabus (in the Neurology lecture) should be viewed. Students are required to complete the selected lectures focusing on general neurology (and to complete the tests available at the end of each lecture) before starting their neurology block. Pre-lectures focused on specific topics of specialty neurology must be completed before the start of the SIMU lectures focused on that topic. For more details, see the Prerequisites section above and/or the commentary on the Interactive Syllabus (in Neurology Lecture).\n\n\n    Pre-clinical knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system will be tested later in the admission test, which will be taken under the supervision of the teacher no later than the second day of the course. A minimum of 80% correct answers is required to pass the test. Students who fail the admission test will have the opportunity to repeat it on the last day of the course (just before the practical exam in neurology).\n\n\n    During the first two days of the course, an introduction to neurological principles and the neurological examination is given and practised. Knowledge of clinical neurological examination and propedeutics will be tested by short oral exams during the second half of the course and by the written intermediate exam on neurological propedeutics, clinical neurological assessment, paraclinical diagnostic methods in neurology during the last week of the course (usually on Wednesday or Friday, i.e. 13th or 15th day of the course).\n\n\n    The other days of the course consist of a clinical part (provided by both the in-patient and out-patient parts of the Neurology Department and special laboratories, i.e. Ultrasound and Clinical Neurophysiology - EMG, EEG, Evoked Potentials, or by SIMU) and focused workshops with specialists in particular areas of neurology.\n\n    Students completing their training in one of the adult neurology departments spend two days of the course in the paediatric neurology department (Children's Hospital, \u010cernopoln\u00ed 9, building G, 4th floor) to learn the basics of paediatric neurology (developmental neurology, neurodevelopmental disorders, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders in childhood, paediatric epileptology). Students who complete their training in the paediatric neurology department spend two days of the course in one of the departments that provide neurological care for adult patients (Department of Neurology, FN Brno or FN USA) in order to learn the basics of adult neurology (stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, diseases of the spine and spinal cord). We strongly recommend that students replace one of their morning lectures with an afternoon lecture (e.g. from 11:00 to 16:00 - i.e. including the morning workshop) or alternatively attend an evening/night duty (based on an individual agreement with the teacher responsible for the particular course). In order to achieve the maximum practical effect of such a substitution, it is preferable to carry it out during the second or third week of the course.\n    On the last (15th) day of the course, the students will take the PRACTICAL EXAM (for credit), which is an integral part of the final exam in Neurology and consists of\n\n\n    a. Clinical examination of the patient (including history), syndromological, topical and differential diagnosis;\n\n\n    b. Oral examination focusing on the clinical neurological examination, neurological propedeutics and the indication and interpretation of basic paraclinical examinations used in neurological patients.\n\n\n    WE WISH TO REMIND STUDENTS THAT THE TIMETABLE OF THE COURSE CAN'T BE CHANGED (except for very serious reasons - stay abroad, long-term illness).\n\n\n\n    More detailed information (including the timetable of your course) can be found on the notice boards in the secretariats of each department. You can also contact the deputy head of the department for further information:\n\n\n    - In FN Brno: Associate Professor Eva Vl\u010dkov\u00e1, MD, PhD (vlckova.eva@fnbrno.cz)\n\n\n    - In FN USA: Associate Professor Martin Pail, MD, PhD (martin.pail@fnusa.cz)\n\n\n    - In FDN: Associate Professor Hana O\u0161lej\u0161kov\u00e1, MD, PhD (oslejskova.hana@fnbrno.cz)\n\n\n    ",
    "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " By the end of the course, students should be able to:\n    - Understand and explain the fundamentals and principles of neurology;\n    - Work with information from the history and neurological examination to identify symptoms/signs and syndromes of neurological disorders;\n    - Make reasoned decisions about the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis based on symptomatology;\n    - Make deductions on the basis of acquired knowledge in the field of neurology;\n    - Identify and interpret basic imaging, laboratory and electrophysiological tests used in neurological patients.

    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The students are examined from this subject at the rigorous examination from surgery in the sixth school year. The knowledge of recommended literature and power point presentations on IS portal are required. Traditional methods are complemented by objective clinical evaluation that verifies clinical knowledge and other skills such as communication, physical examination, performance, performance interpretation, etc. This evaluation method provides students with objective and specific feedback. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " The course is divided into a theoretical introduction with case reports and into presentation of the patients in the wards focused on the use of examination methods, on establishing of the diagnosis and the management of the conditions. Practical training (about 20 % of the total volume of teaching) is complemented by a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on simulators with varying degrees of fidelity, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation results in subsequent debriefing (feedback to the student). There is also problem-oriented learning in the foreground, where the student is taught by solving the problem presented, as well as team-oriented teaching when small groups of students discuss and choose a solution of the problem. Emphasis is also placed on the development of soft skills, incl. so-called \"21st century skills\", particularly communication, decision-making skills, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork.

Students are entitled to acquire 2 ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits upon successful completion of the course.\n    The two courses of Public Health I are mutually dependent, which means that the student has to acquire the 1 ECTS credit of the seminars (aVLOZ0141c) to be qualified for the final (written) exam, which will award them the second 1 ECTS credit.\n    The evaluation system of the seminars (aVLOZ0141c) consists of 18 points that are claimable through attending (and active participation in) the seminars and successful fulfilment of the seminars assignments.\n    Attendance (and active participation) of each seminar will award the student 1 point (x6 points), and successful fulfilment of each ROPOT assignment will award the student 1 point (x6 points). In addition, students are entitled to gain 2 points from ROPOT assignments of the lectures.\n    The final group project can award the student up to 4 points, and the project will be presented in the last week of the course.\n    Students are entitled to sit for the final exam if they achieve 14 out of 18 points.\n\n    Attendance\n    You are expected to attend all the seminars on time.\n    Late coming is defined as the arrival to the seminar room 5 minutes later than the scheduled time of the seminar. Latecomers are not entitled to enter the seminar room without a prospective excuse. On extraordinary occasions, latecomers without prospective apologies may enter the seminar room, and such permission is up to the discretion of the seminar tutor on a case-by-case basis.\n    The location of your seminar room is precisely mentioned in your academic timetable.\n\n    ROPOT Assignments\n    The assignments aim to provide a self-assessment tool for the students to evaluate their performance in studying modules content. Therefore, the students are highly encouraged to resolve assignments honestly and after preparing properly for them.\n    A total of 8 ROPOT assignments (6 seminar ROPOTs + 2 lecture ROPOTs) will be released throughout the semester. Each assignment contains 20-30 multiple-choice questions (MCQ) with a single correct answer.\n    The students will have one week to submit their assignments after the day of its release. If the student does not achieve the passing score of the ROPOT assignment (70%), they will be entitled to retake it in the following week. If the students do not submit their assignments on time, there will be no chance of re-taking the assignment in the second week.

Hypertext teaching materials for the students are available in our teaching rooms as well on the Internet. These materials contain about 3000 images of various imaging methods (macroscopic, x-ray, CT, MRI images, histological images, partially available as virtual slides, videos). Lectures and practicals are complementary. General information and new updates on classifications as well as images are presented at the lectures. Practicals add further information, histopathologically and autoptical experience. Further information is provided in our web-based teaching materials. Various forms of testing are used to give the students proper feedback. Students are supposed to prepare for each practical lesson.

Inflammation of the peritoneum, pathological contents of peritoneal cavity. ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " The main stress in the pathology course is given on macroscopic and microscopic correlation of diseases. After finishing the course the student should be able to: understand the basic pathologic processes (regressive changes, inflammaton, oncology, immune disorders); understand and be able to apply the basic classification of oncologic processes; understand the basic classification of etiologically defined processes (esp. infectious diseases); learn the most important methods used in diagnostic process and research (tissue processing, special stainings, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, molecular pathology); understand various disorders with respect to individual organs and organ systems; get familiar with the process of autopsy (the process of the autopsy and its evaluation); get familiar with laboratory processing of the tissue samples (description, tissue sampling); ",

    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Lectures: 3 hours/week Practical classes: 4 hours/week; microscopic and autoptic lessons. The course of pathology is closed by oral exam. Attendance is compulsory; knowledge of the students is periodically tested during the practical classes. Testing can be either oral or written (multichoice tests, essays). Exam after two semesters of pathology has two parts: practical and theoretical. The practical part of the exam takes the form of a discussion over the microscope or over macroscopical or microscopical images. In the theoretical part of the exam, the students discuss after short preparation randomly selected topics. The list of these topics is available to the students in advance. Traditional methods are complemented by objective clinical evaluation that verifies clinical knowledge and other skills such as communication, physical examination, performance, performance interpretation, etc. This evaluation method provides students with objective and specific feedback. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " Pathology course consists of lectures and practical classes. Teaching consists of theoretical part (lectures) and practical part (laboratory practice). Practical courses consist of histological practice (microscopical and macroscopical images of autoptical and bioptical specimens are demonstrated and discussed) and autoptical practice (presence and ev. participation in autopsies). Hypertext teaching materials for the students are available in our teaching rooms as well on the Internet. These materials contain about 3000 images of various imaging methods (macroscopic, x-ray, CT, MRI images, histological images, partially available as virtual slides, videos). Lectures and practicals are complementary. General information and new updates on classifications as well as images are presented at the lectures. Practicals add further information, histopathologically and autoptical experience. Further information is provided in our web-based teaching materials. Various forms of testing are used to give the students proper feedback. Students are supposed to prepare for each practical lesson. The topic for each practical lesson as well as for each lecture is available. Practical training (about5 % of the total volume of teaching) is complemented by a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on simulators with varying degrees of fidelity, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation results in subsequent debriefing (feedback to the student). There is also problem-oriented learning in the foreground, where the student is taught by solving the problem presented, as well as team-oriented teaching when small groups of students discuss and choose a solution to the problem. Emphasis is also placed on the development of soft skills, incl. so-called \"21st-century skills\", particularly communication, decision-making skills, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork.

    "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the Language Tandem is to encourage liaising between students of the Czech and English programmes. It should provide students of the English programmes with real communication situations that neither their required 8-semester Czech course nor their hospital training can provide. The Language Tandem Course will consist in students (tandem partners) meeting regularly, communicating primarily in Czech, with English (or German, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Arabic etc., depending on the interest or nationality of the tandem partners) as a working language. ",
    "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The minimum acceptable Czech level for an international student of General Medicine, Dentistry or Physiotherapy enrolling in Language Tandem is A2+ level (CEFR). Successful completion of Czech for Foreigners IV is a prerequisite for enrolment in Language Tandem. Czech native speakers in the Czech programme are expected to be at B2/C1 level (CEFR) in English. ",
    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Evaluation will take place in the credit week, i.e. in the last week of the autumn/spring semester of the academic year. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " International students will receive 10 worksheets/topics (corresponding to their level of Czech) from their teachers, on which they will collaborate with Czech students.

    "OBJECTIVES": " In the last two semesters of this three-semester interdisciplinary course, teaching builds upon the previously acquired pathophysiological foundation related to all the selected topics (TBCM 1) by addressing specific clinical cases through the study of 14 virtual patients. Each case is approached using the Team-Based Learning (TBL) structure, which includes individual study preparation with preclass-reading materials, completion of individual and team-based Readiness Assessment Tests (iRAT/tRAT), and problem-solving application exercises. During these exercises, teams discuss the progression of the diagnostic-therapeutic process associated with a specific case study. Students consult their solutions with a facilitator and a clinical expert on the topic. Hence, in each topic, the focus is not on covering the entire clinical domain but on developing clinical reasoning skills within the contours of personalized medicine. ",
    "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The results of the individual Readiness Assessment Test (iRAT) are registered in SIMUportfolio. In case of failure in the iRAT - with a score worse than 60 % - it is not possible to continue in the lesson.\n    Evaluation of team activity: points are awarded at the end of each lesson to whole teams (i.e. all team members present throughout the lesson receive the points allocated) by the content expert based on the monitored activity of each team (clinical reasoning and team communication), with a maximum of 3 points per lesson. Classes are contact-based and attendance is mandatory. A minimum of 5 lessons (out of 7) and a minimum of 5 team points per semester are required for credit. The total score for the team activity will be counted towards the final grade for both semesters, i.e. in the course TBCM III. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " Collaborative learning - TBL (Team-based learning): students work in teams of 7 at tables in a lesson structured into several different activities.\n    Preclass-reading materials: help students become familiar with key concepts and information before they participate in the lesson. Pre-prepared students can focus more on discussion, questioning, and application of concepts during the lesson instead of a classical lecture. Knowledge of the pre-class reading materials is tested using the RAT tests, see below.\n    RATs (Readiness Assessment Tests - iRAT/tRAT/gRA): form the introductory part of the lesson, during which the same test is taken three times in sequence; individually, in small teams around a table, and finally as a whole group. Test format: 10 single-best answer, closed-book questions. The results of the individual tests are collected and after successful completion of the test, the student is allowed to continue in the lesson. Team test results are used as formative assessments for individual teams during the lesson.\n    Tests are taken exclusively in the SIMUportfolio app - you must bring your charged smart phone or laptop with internet connectivity (Eduroam/MUNI network or your own data connection). Application exercise: the virtual patient or interactive fictional patient story allows for practice of clinical reasoning, critical thinking and decision making skills. ",

Justify the steps of clinical reasoning based on knowledge acquired from previous studies in theoretical medical fields;\n    3. Employ principles of evidence-based medicine when deciding on care for a specific \u2013 albeit virtual \u2013 patient;\n    4.

    "SYLLABUS": " Over the course of two semesters, the topics covered include:\n    1. Coagulation disorders, pulmonary embolism\n    2. Metabolic bone disorders in geriatric patient\n    3. Various infections with fever including those of tropical origin\n    4. Digestive tract disorders\n    5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n    6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\n    7.

Impaired consciousness, delirium, convulsions, poisoning\n    13. Meningitidis\n    14. Headaches\n    The timing of individual topics may vary from one academic year to the next. ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " In the last two semesters of this three-semester interdisciplinary course, teaching builds upon the previously acquired pathophysiological foundation related to all the selected topics (TBCM 1) by addressing specific clinical cases through the study of 14 virtual patients. Each case is approached using the Team-Based Learning (TBL) structure, which includes individual study preparation with preclass-reading materials, completion of individual and team-based Readiness Assessment Tests (iRAT/tRAT), and problem-solving application exercises. During these exercises, teams discuss the progression of the diagnostic-therapeutic process associated with a specific case study. Students consult their solutions with a facilitator and a clinical expert on the topic. Hence, in each topic, the focus is not on covering the entire clinical domain but on developing clinical reasoning skills within the contours of personalized medicine. ",
    "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The results of the individual Readiness Assessment Test (iRAT) are registered in SIMUportfolio. In the case of failure in the iRAT - with a score worse than 60 % - it is not possible to continue in the lesson.\n    Evaluation of team activity: points are awarded at the end of each lesson to whole teams (i.e. all team members present throughout the lesson receive the points allocated) by the content expert based on the monitored activity of each team (clinical reasoning, team communication), with a maximum of 3 points per lesson. Final test: a minimum of 5 lessons (out of 7) and a minimum of 5 team points per semester are required for admission to the final test.\n    The evaluation of students in the TBCM III course is based on:\n    1. Points for the team activity from two semesters.\n    2. Points from individual final test in the second semester.\n    The ratio between these components is set at 60:40, which reflects the fact that students gain points for team activities continuously during the two semesters of TBCM II and III through activities aimed at developing clinical reasoning skills, team communication and defending their own opinions. In contrast, the final test represents a one-time verification of knowledge.\n    Points for team activity\n    The evaluation for team activity is based on active cooperation and participation in discussions during both semesters. The maximum number of points achievable during the academic year is 42 points (14 lessons \u00d7 3 points).\n    Final test\n    The final test is part of the evaluation and verifies students' knowledge from all 14 topics covered in the course. The test consists of 42 Single Best Answer (SBA) questions with a time limit of 75 minutes. The test is organized in designated rooms in a closed-book mode without the possibility of using any materials. The attempt to violate the rules of independent work is sanctioned by a system of one warning and, if necessary, subsequent expulsion: the first offense leads to a warning (\"yellow card\"), the second offense to expulsion from the test and an assessment with an \"F\" grade (\"red card\"). In order to ensure the objectivity of the assessment and eliminate the possibility of information being passed between students who take the test on different dates, the questions are divided into multiple test variants.\n    Final classification\n    Grades are based on the sum of the team activity points and final test scores according to the following scale, which was created according to the \"real world\" data of actual exam results from the 4th year compulsory subjects in the last few years.\n    Total score (%) Grade\n    100\u201361 A\n    60\u201341 B\n    40\u201321 C\n    20\u201311 D\n    10\u20135 E\n    less than 5 F\n    To be classified, a student must meet the minimum attendance and team activity points requirements.\n    Specific cases - internships, etc.\n    Given that some groups of students complete two semesters of a subject in an unrelated time period (e.g. as a result of an Erasmus study internship), it is necessary to adjust their evaluation. This will be done while maintaining the above principles as much as possible. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " Collaborative learning - TBL (Team-based learning): students work in teams of 7 at tables in a lesson structured into several different activities.\n    Preclass-reading materials: help students become familiar with key concepts and information before they participate in the lesson. Pre-prepared students can focus more on discussion, questioning, and application of concepts during the lesson instead of a classical lecture. Knowledge of the pre-class reading materials is tested using the RAT tests, see below.\n    RATs (Readiness Assessment Tests - iRAT/tRAT/gRA): form the introductory part of the lesson, during which the same test is taken three times in sequence; individually, in small teams around a table, and finally as a whole group. Test format: 10 single-best answer, closed-book questions. The results of the individual tests are collected and after successful completion of the test, the student is allowed to continue in the lesson. Team test results are used as formative assessments for individual teams during the lesson. Tests are taken exclusively in the SIMUportfolio app - you must bring your charged smart phone or laptop with internet connectivity (Eduroam/MUNI network or your own data connection).\n    Application exercise: the virtual patient or interactive fictional patient story allows for practice of clinical reasoning, critical thinking and decision making skills. ",
    "TEACHER_INFO": " ",
    "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Upon completion of all instructional units during the 2nd and 3rd semesters of TBCM course, students will be able to:\n    1. Apply foundational knowledge from pathophysiology to solve specific clinical problems stemming from the 14 chosen case studies - virtual patients;\n    2. Justify the steps of clinical reasoning based on knowledge acquired from previous studies in theoretical medical fields;\n    3. Employ principles of evidence-based medicine when deciding on care for a specific \u2013 albeit virtual \u2013 patient;\n    4. Defend their stance on the choice of the next step in the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure of a specific case against alternative solutions proposed by peers. ",

    "SYLLABUS": " The lessons are focused on getting both theoretical and practical experience covering the entire area of pulmonology. The practice is done at the bedside in the ward and by demonstrating different methods of examination. The theory is discussed in seminars organized in the Departments pulmonary classroom. Day 1: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Day 2: Asthma bronchiale Day 3: Tuberculosis or lung cancer Day 4: Pneumonia. Day 5: Interstitial lung diseases. In the Simulation Center for Practical Training of Future Physicians, a practical demonstration of propedeutics with physical examinations, pulmonary functional examinations, analysis of blood gas, X-ray findings, drainage of pleural effusions, and bronchoscopic methods will be included. ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " At the end of the course students should be able to understand pathophysiology of breathing, pulmonary function tests (spirometric, pletysmography, oxygen measurements), basic diagnosis and diferrential diagnosis of lung diseases (pneumonia, asthma bronchiale, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, lung cancer, interstitial lung disease). Students should be able to understand basic X-ray interpretation. Students will be able to use the acquired information in differential diagnosis of dyspnea, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis. ",
    "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The semester is closed by completing a simple multiple-choice test or an oral exam covering the information presented at the seminars. A 100% participation is a precondition for granting the credit. Traditional methods are complemented by objective clinical evaluation that verifies clinical knowledge and other skills such as communication, physical examination, performance, performance interpretation, etc. This evaluation method provides students with objective and specific feedback. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " The lesson consists of the theory and the clinical practice (practical group projects - examinations of patients, descriptions of chest X-ray, presentations by professionals). It is assumed that the student has knowledge of pathological physiology, propedeutics and pharmacology. Practical training (about 10 % of the total volume of teaching) is complemented by a comprehensive range of simulation teaching methods on simulators with varying degrees of fidelity, trainers and virtual patients. Simulation results in subsequent debriefing (feedback to the student). There is also problem-oriented learning in the foreground, where the student is taught by solving the problem presented, as well as team-oriented teaching when small groups of students discuss and choose a solution of the problem. Emphasis is also placed on the development of soft skills, incl. so-called \"21st century skills\", particularly communication, decision-making skills, critical thinking, crisis communication and teamwork. ",
    "TEACHER_INFO": " Before the beginning of the teaching, students will pick up the key from the cloakroom at the clinic's secretary (1st floor, building E). After changing clothes, students will meet in the seminar room on the ground floor of building E (next to the department of pulmonary function measurements. ",
    "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Students should be able:\n    - to understand diagnostics and differential diagnosis of pulmonary diseases,\n    - evaluate physical findings of patients with lung disease,\n    - interpret pulmonary functional and radiological findings and suggest treatment. ",

    "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the tuition is working knowledge of the Czech language on the B1/B2 level of the \"Common European Framework of Reference\" (CEFR)(Independent User) checked by an examination. ",
    "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The main aim of the course Czech for Foreigners is to teach students to communicate with patients in Czech without any help from English speaking doctors or interpreters and independently write case history. Students can understand information related to very familiar topics that they regularly encounter at school, in the hospital, and in their free time, provided the information is communicated clearly. Students can write simple texts on familiar topics and topics related to their interest, and understand texts that consist of high-frequency everyday or job-related language. 3rd and 4th-year course focus lie in specialized terminology. The seminars concentrate on practicing thematic doctor-patient dialogues and specialised medical terminology with the use of course book based and teacher created exercises. ",
    "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The tuition is realised in the form of practical courses. The students' presence in these courses is strictly required; a maximum of two unexcused absences is tolerated. If a student has more than two unexcused absences, they will not be allowed to take the Final test. A student is obliged to provide a written excuse letter to the faculty Office for Studies justifying his/her absence within five workdays of the teaching activity he/she was absent from. The tuition is finished by an end-of-term examination (ETE) consisting of a WRITTEN and an ORAL part. Passing the examination is conditioned by proper attendance, ACTIVE PARTICIPATION in practical courses, sitting for Progress Tests and successful passing of written and oral exams. The basic limit for passing all tests is 70%.There will be three Progress tests (1 written, 2 oral), each for 50 points (altogether 150 points). In case of passing three Progress tests (passmark for each test is 35/50 points) the basic limit in the credit test is reduced by 10%. If students a) succesfully pass all progress tests (must be taken only during test week), b) get at least 135 points in total (both conditions must be met), they do not have to take the written part of Colloquium. The basic limit for passing all tests is 70%. Without successful passing the written exam students will not be allowed to sit for the oral part. Any copying, recording or leaking tests, use of unauthorized tools, aids and communication devices, or other disruptions of objectivity of exams (credit tests) will be considered non-compliance with the conditions for course completion as well as a severe violation of the study rules. Consequently, the teacher will finish the exam by awarding grade \"F\" in the Information System. ",
    "TEACHING_METHODS": " The tuition is realised in the form of practical courses. The following teaching methods are used: class discussion, roleplay, work in groups, reading, listening, writing HW (including Projects), word study. ",
    "TEACHER_INFO": " Information about the subject, consultation hours, etc. is accessible on the notice boards at the Language Center, Faculty of Medicine Division. Contact with teachers is provided by the secretary of the department (Kamenice 5, A15), tel.: 549 498 170. ",
    "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " At the end of the course students should be able to:\n    - use practical dentistry vocabulary\n    - apply dentistry language in doctor-patient and doctor-nursing staff communication;\n    - present and discuss specialized topics ",

Activation of T and B cells by antigen. Interactions between antigen-presenting cells and T- and B-lymphocytes. Regulation of the immune reaction. Mucosal immunity. Immunity against infectious agents. Microbial antigens. Active and passive immunisation. ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " The course covers basic aspects of the structure and function of the immune system in humans. Topics include mechanisms of non- specific immunity with the main emphasis on the inflammatory process, such as humoral and cellular branches of the specific immune response. It includes mainly mechanisms of activation of the immune response and its regulation. Special emphasis is given to mucosal immunity and immune response to microbes and immunoprophylaxis to infectious and non-infectious diseases in the orofacial area. After finishing the course the students will understand the mechanisms of the immune response in physiology, and the knowledge will enable them to understand the immune system disturbances leading to immunopathological diseases.

Disease is usually (with exception of sudden events) a long terms process hidden (asymptomatic) for some time and only later and under certain circumstances might become clinically apparent illness. We aim to help the students to understand WHY and HOW are the changes unfolded. We also aspire to facilitate understanding disease etiopathogenesis complexly, i.e. from initial molecular and/or genetic alterations, via cellular, tissue and organ or event. systemic process. Pathophysiology represents an integrating discipline in medical curriculum bridging the theoretical/preclinical and clinical phase. Inextricably, despite the predominantly theoretical nature of the subject, we want to contribute to the building of the \u201eevidence based medicine\u201c paradigm accompanied by the appreciation of the \u201eprecision medicine\u201c concept.

    "SYLLABUS": " - The psychology of perception and attention: Do we see the world as it actually is? What are the common misconceptions about how we process information?\n    - Memory and thinking: How can we memorize material effectively? Is human memory reliable? How do we work with the information that we store?\n    - Learning: How does experience shape our behaviour and view of the world? How to form new habits and change old habits?\n    - Basic human needs: How is food consumption regulated in human individuals? How are attitudes towards different food-related behaviours formed? How is sleep and other physiological needs regulated, and how do they become dysregulated?\n    - Motivation: What are the different types of motivation, and what are their consequences? How can different motivational dispositions be recognized and harnessed for facilitating behavioural change?\n    - Emotion: How are emotions formed, how they can be recognized, and what are their functions? What are the different approaches to emotion regulation, and how to choose and practice strategies for better impulse control?\n    - Intelligence: What are cognitive abilities, and how they can be distinguished from cognitive skills? How can abilities be tested? What are the limits of communication and competence in people with diminished intelligence?\n    - Personality: What are stable traits? Where do they come from? How do they affect our lives? Can we predict people's behaviour based on levels of traits obtained through psychological assessment?\n    - Healthy development: How do nature and nurture contribute to what becomes of a child in the future? What does healthy cognitive and social development look like? What can one expect of children of various ages, and how to interact with them effectively?\n    - Parenting and disharmonious development: What does research show about effective parenting strategies to help the child become a well-functioning person? What are the essential ingredients of healthy personality development, and what happens when these are absent at the crucial points? What are the consequences of psychological deprivation, neglect and abuse in childhood?\n    - Mental disorders: What are the basic types of mental disorders and what do they look like? Which social stigmas are mental patients faced with, and how do stereotypes compare to reality? How do we recognize that someone needs psychological help? What are the principles of effective and compassionate communication with people suffering from a mental disorder?\n    - Psychological aspects of physical illness and disability: Which aspects of psychological experience should be taken into account when treating patients with different types of physical illness or disability?\n    - Fundamentals of medical psychology and humanistic approach to patients: What are the differences between the biomedical and the biopsychosocial approach to health and illness? What kinds of patient-professional interaction are likely to facilitate the healing process, treatment adherence and positive change, and which, on the other hand, might undermine progress and adherence? What is adherence determined by? How do placebo and nocebo effects, transference, countertransference, etc., work? ",
    "OBJECTIVES": " - Provide science-based insight into the way in which the human mind processes and stores information;\n    - Show students how to distinguish between more and less malleable and flexible factors in human functioning to help them understand the origins of different aspects of behaviour and promote a compassionate, empathetic and effective communication with patients;\n    - Introduce students to the principles and aspects of human development and psychopathology that will help them better understand and respond to special needs of different individuals and enhance their communication skills;\n    - Introduce students to the psychological aspects of illness and disability and elements of interaction between the patient and a health professional that might have an impact on the progress and effectiveness of treatment;\n    - Provide students with basic science-based knowledge that might help them study more efficiently and improve their own everyday functioning.

    "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " The student will acquire knowledge and skills in the field of ethics in health care, become familiar with the basic principles of medical ethics and dilemmas concerning the life of an individual (e.g. birth, death, allocation of resources, organ donation) as well as legal and ethical standards in the provision of health care (e.g. informed consent, institute of advance wishes, principles of medical ethics). Emphasis is placed on a deeper understanding of fundamental (bio)ethical issues in the form of discussions, where different opinions are often heard. Students will learn to cultivate their opinions and present appropriate argumentative procedures supported by reading recommended sources. The course also focuses on ethical issues of practicing the healthcare profession, introduces the integration of ethical principles into the Code of Ethics for non/medical healthcare professionals, and addresses ethical dilemmas in the actions and behavior of healthcare professionals towards patients and clients.
