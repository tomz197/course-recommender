        "OBJECTIVES": " Teaching physics is not an end in itself. The subject is thematically oriented so that the basic information about the function of the human body and its organs is presented to the students at the lectures (selected key themes), then discussed in Seminars and applied in Practice where the student will actively participate in the realization of concrete tasks , exercises and tests and program essays. Part of the Exercise will be the separate elaboration of worksheets.\n    The course is designed so that the student can understand the basic functions of the human body as a whole, as well as the function of the organs, and understand the mutual interaction of the human organism and the external environment for the maintenance of homeostasis.\n    Similarly, it will be mentioned how the function of the human organism (and the function of its individual organs) will affect the physical burden, illness, stress,\n    Students are familiar with differences in the functions of the human body in childhood, adulthood and old age.\n    Knowledge gained through the study of Physiology will allow students to understand the concepts and processes in the human organism that the student encounters in the next follow-up studies at FSpS. Understand the changes that occur in our organism in individual types of sport, it will know how to focus and individualize the training and regeneration load. The completion of the subject of Physiology is a necessary prerequisite for enrollment of subjects related to further study at FSpS. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The basic prerequisite for the beginning of Physiology studies are:\n    - Regular enrollment of the subject\n    - student knowledge at the level of biology teaching at high school\n    - knowledge gained through study in the subject ANATOMY (bp4008). ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Subject physiology is normally completed by credit and examination.\n    The basic prerequisite for granting the credit is:\n    a) fulfillment of the duties prescribed within the subject (successful completion of Exercises and Seminars, elaboration of worksheets and semestral project). Compliance with these obligations is necessary to complete the credit test.\n    b) passing a credit test (50 questions - maximum possible number of points obtained = 50) at least 70%.\n    Entry to the oral exam is conditional upon the award of the Credit.\n    Participation in seminars and seminars is mandatory. A maximum of 2 absences are tolerated, topics missing and need to be explained. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " A) Lectures of selected topics - as an introduction to study.\n    B) Exercises and seminars include both theoretical and practical part of teaching. Prerequisite for participation in the Exercise is the knowledge of basic information about the particular lesson.\n    C) Self-study of recommended literature\n    Teaching methods: presentation, discussion, practical measurements, group projects, essay processing, brainstorming. Testing knowledge. ",
        "TEACHER_INFO": " ",
        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Successful completion of the subject of Physiology will make it possible to understand the basic principles of homeostasis (ability to stabilize the internal environment of the organism), which are a necessary condition for the function of the organism as a whole, as well as its individual organs.\n    Understand what is happening in the human organism, due to the burden, age, illness, stress,\n    The acquired knowledge will allow to understand the basic functions of the human body as a whole (system), and from the point of view of the function of the individual organs.\n    Graduates of the FSpS have to know the possibilities of adapting, training, loading and regeneration of the organism in childhood, adulthood and old age.\n    The knowledge gained in this subject will allow students to understand the concepts and processes in the human organism with which the FSpS student will meet in related subjects. Thanks to the knowledge of the body's function, it understands the changes that occur in our body in individual types of sports and will know how to focus and individualize the training and regeneration load.\n    The completion of the subject of Physiology is a necessary prerequisite for enrollment of subjects related to further study at FSpS.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Teaching Physics is not an end in itself. The subject is thematically oriented so that the basic information about the function of the human body and its organs is presented to the students at the lectures (selected key themes), then discussed in Seminars and practically applied in the Exercise, where the student will actively participate in the realization of specific tasks , exercises and tests and program essays. Part of the Exercise will be the separate elaboration of worksheets.\n    The course is designed so that the student can understand the basic functions of the human body as a whole, as well as the function of the organs, and understand the mutual interaction of the human organism and the external environment for the maintenance of homeostasis.\n    Similarly, it will be mentioned how the function of the human organism (and the function of its individual organs) will affect the physical burden, illness, stress,\n    Students are familiar with differences in the functions of the human body in childhood, adulthood and old age.\n    Knowledge gained through the study of Physiology will allow students to understand the concepts and processes in the human organism that the student encounters in the next follow-up studies at FSpS. Understand the changes that occur in our organism in individual types of sport, it will know how to focus and individualize the training and regeneration load. The completion of the subject of Physiology is a necessary prerequisite for enrollment of subjects related to further study at FSpS. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The Physiology course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of fundamental physiological principles and mechanisms that govern the functioning of the human body. Students will explore the organization of the human organism at the cellular, tissue, organ, and system levels, gaining deeper insight into key physiological processes. The course covers cellular physiology, including transport mechanisms and energy metabolism, and gradually expands knowledge on the physiology of muscle tissue, bones and joints, the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, hemodynamics, blood pressure regulation, as well as the respiratory, digestive, and excretory systems. Emphasis is placed on the interconnection of these systems and their regulatory mechanisms, which ensure homeostasis and adaptation to various conditions. The aim of the course is not only to provide theoretical knowledge but also to foster critical thinking and the ability to apply acquired knowledge in practical situations. ",

        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Upon completing the Physiology course, the student will be able to: Understand the fundamental functions of the human body as a whole and recognize how individual organs and systems interact to maintain homeostasis. Apply theoretical knowledge in practice through active participation in assignments, drills, tests, program essays, and independent completion of worksheets. Analyze the impact of external factors on the human body's functions, including the effects of physical exertion, disease, stress, and other influences on individual organs and overall bodily function. Identify physiological differences across various life stages, from childhood to adulthood and old age. Utilize acquired knowledge in further studies at FSpS, where it will be essential for understanding related subjects. Prepare for future studies and professional practice, where an understanding of physiological processes will enable more effective application of knowledge in fields such as sports science, rehabilitation, healthcare, and human movement research.

        "SYLLABUS": " On the content side, it is probably best illustrated by the titles and subtitles of some of the lectures:\n    -Tur de Franz or from Kafka to Armstrong. * A tale of  human desire, strong arms and how to get a trumpet to the moon without falling off the  wheel (key theme - \"performance company and its alternatives\").\n    -Why didn't Pistorius get an Oscar? * A tale of  human otherness and the dark recesses of the thirteenth chamber (a key theme - \"status of minorities, disadvantage and favouritism\").\n    -How many meters is Caster Semenya allowed to run? * A story about transgender in sport, or about running from gender through transgender back to somewhere gender (key theme - \"gender\").\n    -If you can't, join in and think about it. * A tale of  immeasurable diligence, resilience and  what teeth the donated medal sits on the themes of Emile Shine's Infinity Story (2 key themes and their synergies - \"finding new ways and ethical aspects of the journey\").\n\n    Other key themes are listed below: racism, violence in society, the environmental dimension of sport, social networks, gamification and sportification, liberalism versus paternalism.\n    Three other topics are optional. Their choices are decided by the students themselves with their voting during the third week of the semester. Optional topics are timed as lectures No. 10-12. This is a pilot launch of the subject. Meaningful changes to this curriculum are therefore possible if there is cause for them and if there is agreement on them. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The object of the course is to bring students to a stand-alone thinking about social events around us (and evaluating the circumstances and consequences of these events) through discussions and analyses devoted to events in the world of sport. The aim (in sub-attributes) is to build an analytical approach to  problems (mainly in philosophical discourse), to promote a creative approach and autonomy in  creative expression (in discussions and in the production of an essay), as well as an interdisciplinary understanding of events (including the ability to work with salacious puns and humour).\n    note The subject, with its title, reports on the  legacy of Lewis Carroll's work. This Oxford mathematics professor was able to write poetic stories for children, in which adults also find lessons. We, too, follow the \"tangled story\" of contemporary sport and stand often as \"Alice in Wonderland\" hidden \"behind a mirror\" in amazement at the paradox of the veracity of the clich\u00e9 that sport is a mirror of society. Above the selected stories of athletes and other prominent figures, the subject gives an insight into the fundamental themes of the contemporary world (environmental issues, gender, racism, violence in society, pressure on performance, equal opportunities, etc.) in  sociological, but above all philosophical discourse. Within the university-wide base, this is a  subject that touches upon (at least through its impacts) all disciplines and goes across the curriculum. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The goal of the \u201cCORE149 DATA-A: Data Analysis for Everyone\u201d course is to introduce students to the key principles and procedures of data analysis so that they can effectively apply them in their field of study and in everyday life. The course is designed primarily for students in non-mathematical degree programs, focusing on practical demonstrations and clear explanations. Students will learn to understand different types of data, select and apply suitable analytical procedures, interpret the results, and communicate them in a comprehensible manner. The course includes interactive demonstrations of more than 30 different types of analyses, covering both general and field-specific scenarios. The course builds on general knowledge of data processing and presentation, expanding it with a critical approach to data and the ability to assess data quality in relation to research objectives. Its interdisciplinary scope helps students develop competences that foster better collaboration with experts across various fields. The skills acquired can be applied in subsequent courses focusing on statistical methods, research projects, and advanced data analysis, as well as to better understand the world around them and support creative and scientific endeavors. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " This course does not require any strict formal prerequisites. However, to make the most of the course content, it is advisable that students:\n    - have basic computer skills (operating system navigation, file management, navigating the university information system),\n    - be familiar with spreadsheet software (e.g., MS Excel, Google Sheets) at a basic level,\n    - possess at least a high-school level of mathematical knowledge (basic arithmetic, working with percentages and fractions),\n    - be willing to actively participate in discussions and practical assignments during seminars, - install the recommended statistical software (e.g., JASP, SPSS, MATLAB) and bring their own laptop to each seminar.\n\n    The above-mentioned skills and knowledge will make it easier to follow the course material and complete practical tasks, but they are not strictly required for enrollment. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " During the semester, active participation in seminars is required, allowing a maximum of three unexcused absences. Any additional absences must be properly excused according to MU\u2019s Study and Examination Regulations. Knowledge acquisition is primarily verified by short written tests (KvIS) at the end of each seminar, and students must achieve at least 60% of the total possible points for a passing grade in the continuous assessment. Students who do not meet this requirement may take a final exam (colloquium). During this exam, they will be given a randomly selected assignment requiring them to choose an appropriate test, conduct the data analysis, interpret the results, and describe their procedure. Only personal notes and course materials may be used; the use of the internet or AI-based tools is prohibited. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " The course is conducted in the form of seminars, where students are introduced to the theoretical framework of the subject and simultaneously gain hands-on experience using pre-prepared data available in the information system. Each seminar includes a discussion of theoretical foundations, a collaborative data analysis session, and a short written test (KvIS), for which achieving at least 60% of the possible points is required to receive credit. Three times during the semester, students will also complete a feedback questionnaire that serves to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching process and, if necessary, adjust the course content or methods of working with data.

During the exercises, the emphasis is on proper breathing and exercises are done at a slow pace, the technique of the exercises performed is important. The exercise is aimed as a compensation for sedentary work (especially when working at a computer), during which there is an excessive load on the spine due to long-term sitting with a round back, which leads to increased pressure on the intervertebral discs. During this lesson we will focus mainly on relaxing the spine and stretching the muscles along the spine, we will further stretch and slightly strengthen the muscles of the whole body and also the deep muscles. During this lesson, for example, overballs or cylinders are used as exercise aids (if we will practice in person, of course). ",

        "SYLLABUS": " Women's self-defense forms a separate chapter of self-defense, especially because women are much more often exposed to the risk of sexual or domestic violence. Given the physiological and psychological differences between women and men, it is important to emphasize prevention, strengthening self-confidence and effective verbal communication, in which women excel. These skills help reduce the risk of physical conflict, but do not completely eliminate it. In cases of conflict escalation, it is necessary to recognize warning signs and respond to them quickly and effectively. The program focuses on women's self-defense with an emphasis on the issue of sexual harassment, which will be introduced to participants in a ten-hour course. It combines theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The first part of the program will emphasize prevention, strengthening self-confidence, effective verbal communication and expanding knowledge about the issue of sexual harassment. The second part of the program will begin with an explanation of the legal concept and necessary defense, which will provide participants with an overview of the legal aspects of acting in crisis situations. This theoretical part will be followed by practical training in physical self-defense and defensive techniques, for example using improvised weapons, where participants will learn effective ways to confront an attacker, even with the help of commonly available objects. In the final phase, the course will deal with the post-conflict phase, ensuring safety and seeking help. Finally, participants will try applying the acquired knowledge and skills in solving model situations. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " They will expand their knowledge in the field of prevention, strategies and tactics of self-defense. They will expand their knowledge in the field of sexual harassment and its solution. They will acquire skills in basic technical means of self-defense They will become familiar with the possibilities of using common objects as defense tools They will understand the legal conditions of self-defense ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " This course aims to teach the fundamentals of scientific writing. Instruction will focus primarily on the process of writing and publishing scientific manuscripts.\n    The course will be presented in two segments:\n    Part (1) teaches students how to write effectively, concisely, and clearly.\n    Part (2) will take them through the preparation of an actual scientific manuscript. The focus will be on how to write and increase the chance of publishing the scientific text. There is an increasing need among doctoral candidates to publish their work in various types of academic publications and engage with a wider range of academic, professional and public audiences. The goal of this course is to familiarize doctoral candidates with different approaches to scientific writing, take their academic writing skills in English to a higher level and offer them a range of tools to adapt their focus of language to address their target readers at specific, multi-disciplinary and general levels. The course addresses firstly the context of scientific writing to situate the styles of writing that doctoral candidates are working with. It will discuss aspects of clear and concise writing style, and lexical and discourse relationship patterns in academic text, along with functional perspectives for positioning and structuring information and argument in the wider scope of thesis and journal article writing.

It provides concepts, theoretical approaches, and research methods to describe and understand behaviour and social interactions as they occur in particular social and cultural contexts. Just qualitative changes in sports have updated new concepts as physical recreation, professional sport, high-performance sport, elite sport etc. Becoming involved and staying in sports occurs in connection with the general socialization process in the lives of people. The phenomenon of sport has been strongly transformed during the past two or three decades, mostly as a consequence of the process of commercialisation and medialization of elite professional sports, mostly to a global extent. The main objective of the lesson is to properly understand the mutual relations of sport and society in local, regional and global contexts. ",

Wellness perceives the quality of life from a holistic perspective as the balance of the individual dimensions (life processes) and handles the responsibility for achieving it in the hands of the patient, not the doctor. On the principles of humanistic psychology, Rogers' therapy, client-oriented, positive psychology and similar approaches, this concept helps a person to live a quality life, to be responsible for their actions, and to be aware of the interrelationship between quality life and human health - even a physically ill person can live a quality life. And so does a healthy person do not live well, do not eat well. The subject provides basic knowledge of alternative massage directions. Part of the subject will be not only description and practice of massage as such, explanation of massage techniques, but also a comparison of these \"Alternative\" massages with the classic type of massage.

It stands out for its versatility, like other martial arts it is an excellent basis for self-defense for men and women. It is probably best known for its two-stick technique, which excellently develops hand-eye coordination and also enables students to develop bilateral motor skills, i.e. not only the dominant hand. Kombatan focuses on compact, fast movements, called flow, which differentiates it from some more static styles. In its wide range of techniques, it offers the use of short and long weapons (sticks, blades), police techniques, unarmed combat and wrestling, which makes it a style suitable for basically everyone. In the Philippines, where this style originates, it is commonly taught in elementary schools and is part of the training of not only the Philippine Armed Forces, but also the armed forces of other nations.
