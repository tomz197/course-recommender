        "OBJECTIVES": " It is a course with a motivational-methodological-paradigmatic mission to open students' thinking towards the coming era of massive use of artificial intelligence (AI) in all aspects. It is about the link between intelligence in the general sense and the design of general-purpose information processing machines (computers) with implications concerning the replacement of human cognitive activities by intelligently acting machines both in the position of cooperating with humans and as their adversaries, including implications for the cybersecurity of systems deployed so far (in both mentioned positions), but secure systems building on AI and avoiding the conflict between the goals pursued by the machine and the interests corresponding to humans. This includes fundamental ethical issues, including implications for security policies (from local to geopolitical). It broadens the technical-operational perspective of the computer-security expert, in the ability to perceive a forward-looking view and be aware of the threats and opportunities that come with AI in the world of cybersecurity. The ambition of the course is not necessarily to teach the techniques directly used, but rather to provide a mental preparation for a world where opportunities are yet to be born, to see these techniques in the context of their evolution, status, potential, and with them, the definition of the role of AI with the broad implications that will come from these techniques, or techniques that will complement/overlay them..

The main goal is to provide students with basic idea what are the expected applications of quantum information processing, how quantum computing and communication works, and give them practical experience how to program quantum computer. All programming will be performed using Python language and IBM Quiskit library.\n\n\n    As a part of the course we want students to become comfortable with basic mathematics necessary for quantum information processing. While you already know almost all necessary mathematics from prerequisite courses, there is a big difference between knowing something and being able to use it an intuitive and efficient way.\n\n\n    The course is designed in the way that it introduces in a parallel way basic quantum information applications, necessary mathematical concepts and teaches how to implement these applications on quantum computers. As an example, on second lecture you will learn about BB84 quantum key distribution. On this concept we will explain what quantum state is, what is a quantum measurement, and we will learn how to implement BB84 using the Quiskit Python library. In this way we avoid boring monothematical blocks of mathematics.\n\n\n    This course will be in future followed by two advanced courses. The second course will introduce all necessary concepts of quantum information processing \u2013 necessary concepts from mathematics, physics and informatics, so that student will have all theoretical knowledge necessary to work with quantum information processing. The third course will explain the applications of quantum information processing in full scale \u2013 communication, algorithms, cryptography, NP-approximation, machine learning, simulation of physical and chemical systems.\n\n    ",

We will focus on several representative use cases motivated by the real needs of life scientists and clinicians to illustrate the societal impact computer science can have in these fields. Perhaps most importantly, however, the course aims at bootstrapping an interdisciplinary community of young professionals who can deliver new results in this exciting field that are both technically sound and practically grounded.

The students will be familiarized with the writing of topic sentences, thesis statements, and coherent and cohesive paragraphs. The students will practice these steps of the writing process via in-class writing, text analysis, and written homework. Focus is placed on elegant and clear style rather than the frequently needlessly complex and obtrusive style of many non-native speakers. The course also focuses on how to properly cite and how to use AI tools in their writing. While some grammatical aspects of English used in the academia will be touched upon in the class (e.g. the passive voice), the course is not a language class and those not familiar with given grammar will need to improve their knowledge sufficient for class purposes through external means.

In order to be able to sit for the oral part of the exam, students need to reach a minimum score of 60% in the test (excluding the formal email).\n    The written test is an in-person Use of English Test based on upper-intermediate grammar. Students can be exempt from most of the written part of the exam (but they still have to take the email writing part and the oral part) if they have the following certificates (not older than four years): Cambridge English: First (previously FCE), Advanced (previously CAE), Proficiency (previously CPE); IELTS band score 5.5/6.5 or higher; TOEFL iBT Total score 87 or higher. Secondary school exams (i.e. maturita) are not accepted. Students must submit their certificate one month prior to the start of the exam period in which they wish to take VB001. The formal email is compulsory for all students and is based on the instructions on writing formal emails that are part of the English I curriculum.\n    The oral examination has two parts: an in-person presentation on an IT-related topic delivered in front of an audience followed by a discussion based on one of the presentations. To facilitate the discussion, students need to prepare a handout to complement their presentations. The following criteria are taken into consideration for the presentation part, so students are strongly advised to bear those in mind while presenting: good content, clear structure, good conclusion, usage of signposting, correct usage of English (self-correction is possible and welcomed), relevant range of vocabulary and correct pronunciation (avoiding irritating mistakes), stress and intonation, quality and language of visuals and references (excluding wikipedia), eye contact with the audience and proper body language, good timing, handling the Q&A session and overall impression (fun, passion, expertise, effort..., fluency, dress code). For the discussion, students are expected to bring a good-quality handout (FI unified style, goal of presentation, bullet points, question for discussion) and be active within the discussion. This includes turn-taking, negotiating, agreeing and disagreeing using relevant and appropriate language. The whole group is also rewarded a point if they reach a conclusion.\n    The level of the exam is B2 of the Common European Framework (Upper Intermediate). ",

        "SYLLABUS": " The term \"politics\" seems to us to cover primarily the area of \"governance\"; and that for the people of particular countries, including their attitudes and property. \"Political power\" in many countries still should be also a guarantee of the presentation of a particular religious belief or what and how to produce or with whom and under what conditions of trade; and also whether and how to allow a possible share in these dispositions, especially in political (and economic, etc.) institutions.\n    We will note currently how the notion of democracy has changed in, say, the Czech Republic (or South Africa, or the Commonwealth). An extremely important topic is connected with the concept of the EU; we should not forget T. G. Masaryk as the practical implementator of this idea for Central Europe. Especially in the last hundred years, the whole world has changed seriously in almost all its major aspects, from the current threat of nuclear conflict to the possible incapacity to deal effectively with terrorism; it has been long enough to talk seriously about the climate crisis without sufficient results (what, how and when our mankind will do to avert the approaching disaster).\n    In this cherished topic, many traditions have changed in some areas so that it is difficult to compare \"democracy\" or \"civic values\". Interest in the exercise of political rights is in many places visibly declining or adequately excluded. It is desirable to be topical and concrete rather than exhaustively \"systematic\". (Is our world today only binary \"contradictory\", or is it variable and in more ways difficult to define, to predict its prospects?) ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " Science of politics is here taken as a historically conditioned and steadily topical issue of changing presuppositions structuring and reflecting political might. It traces the development from the antique Greek democracy till contemporaneity (with parallel enjambments in our time). Continuous commenting of weighty news characterising the common \"roots\" coupled with them, has been considered, also actually including an updated task for each man in the state to become a good and responsible citizen. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " Interest in temporarily conditioned changes of the phenomenon of politics is expected. There are various enjambments from other spheres of human activities in politics preventing the understanding of fundamental ideas in it and the risks connected with it. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The Lecturer permits his student being absent twice To positively finish this study. To get the credit the student also presents an essay (the theme will be announced in the second half of October); size \"12\", at least 45 lines, with at least 4 quotations (numbered: (1)...). These citations will be quoted at the end of the essay, with their full reference. The student presents his/her essay before the end of November.

One of the main focus of the course is formal and informal language and the fact that both have their places in professional and, to lesser extent, academic contexts. As there are multiple ways of maintaining formality, a proper grasp of its use can is needed to successfully navigate the complexities of everyday experiences in academia and professional work. Ultimately, formal and informal language are about presenting oneself to the world; as a result, presentations themselves as well as the ability to effectively summarize information will also be covered in the course. In other words, the course aims at improving not only the more language-oriented aspects of formal and informal English, but also the more abstract ways of thinking about oneself and the self's relation to the outside world.

Formal/informal exam There will be an in-class exam in Week 7. The exam focuses on formal/informal and personal/impersonal vocabulary as well as grammar and overall style. Presentation Students will give a presentation during the last week of the course. The presentations should last between 10 and 15 minutes and the topic will be chosen after a discussion with the instructor. Summary assignment This assignment takes place during the examination period and has two parts. First, students will write a summary of a source, and then they will review two other summaries written by their peers. Homework assignments For majority of classes students need to submit written assignments. These are separated into two types \u2013 minor assignments and major assignments. Minor assignments are evaluated based on submitted/not submitted basis. Major assignments are graded according to the quality of the submission. Assignments are always given for the following week (so the assignment in Week 1 is due before Week 2).

        "OBJECTIVES": " Writing a thesis is frequently a long and arduous process and even more so when it has to be written in a language other than the author\u2019s primary language. Therefore, this course is aimed at helping students who are in their last semester of studies to finish writing their theses. The course is separated into two tracks \u2013 a class track and an individual track. During the former, students attend six classes with the instructor and focus on the process of writing a thesis; the track will cover not only common grammar mistakes, but also the academic writing style or the mechanics of writing a thesis. The individual track has students write portions of their theses and then meet with the instructor on scheduled dates in his office to receive feedback on their writing. There will be three individual sessions, each lasting approximately 20 minutes. Students may be required to submit additional grammar and vocabulary exercises during both tracks. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " The prerequisite for enrolling in is having at least a B2-level knowledge of English, as this course is not focused on grammar or vocabulary.
