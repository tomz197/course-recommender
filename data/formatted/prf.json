The course is complementary to the practical training and allows students to deepen their knowledge and especially the skills required for the diploma assignment in both civil and criminal procedure. The course will focus on solving a specific assignment from both areas, which students will develop in a faculty setting under the conditions they would have for a thesis assignment (in particular, access to legal databases, working with a thesis answer book, etc.). Subsequently, students will receive feedback from the lecturers, which will allow them to focus on any shortcomings in the preparation for the \"sharp\" diploma assignment at the end of their studies.

        "SYLLABUS": " 1. Law as a social phenomenon: explaining what law is and explaining that even if we don't know what it is, we can work with it quite well. The nature of law as a social (artificial) phenomenon that takes abstract and conceptual form. An introduction to the basic principles that guide legal thinking and are based on general human thought. The relationship between society and the individual, the limits of freedom and constraints. The individual at the mercy of the legal system. Relationship between the written (sources) and the thought (norm): when something is written, it does not mean that it is so. Relationship between theory and practice: influence of social practice on law and necessary connection to society (if it is not implemented, it is not law). International and European view of the law - is there only one law? The relationship between the outside (international space) and the inside (national space). What is meant by the principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse or suffer? 2. Principles of the modern state: what are the principles of the modern state? How have they developed over the last 250 years? The modern state principles are essential in that they determine how the state may (may) treat the individual (elaborating on the basic thesis of the first lecture) and vice versa. The concept of constitutionalism: a constitution binds the modern state, and the constitution is a kind of (approximate) realistic representation of the social contract. A basic definition of the concepts of democracy, the rule of law, separation of powers and fundamental rights and an explanation of the relationships between them (synergies and tensions) using real examples from recent times (pandemics, LGBTQ rights, abortion). 3. The rule of law: Philosophical roots of the rule of law (limitations on the power of the governed, guarantee of liberty). The evolution of the rule of law. Analysis of the individual features of the rule of law: the binding of public authority by law, claims to the \"quality\" of law (legal certainty in general, accessibility, intelligibility, prohibition of retroactivity, stability, enforceability, etc.). What practical limits does the rule of law encounter, and how to deal with them? Can a person know the law, even if it is theoretically available to him? What impact, for example, does the instability of law (frequent amendments) and overregulation have on the rule of law? 4. The basic definition of the separation of powers and its meaning. Is it specialisation, another guarantee of individual freedom or both? Explanation of the separation of functions on the one hand and the system of checks and balances on the other. Introductory overview and characteristics of the organs of the state. What all has to happen in terms of the separation of powers for the state to be able to interfere in the rights of the individual: demonstration by an example from the field of criminal law (explanation of the \"chain of the exercise of state power\" from the legislative initiative through the enactment of the law, the role of the executive, the judicial procedure to the eventual conviction and execution of the sentence). Self-government as vertical separation of powers? European and international law and powers of international bodies (especially within the EU). 5. The system of law: the basic structure of the legal system, the interconnection of the different parts, public and private law: the basic principles of these branches (standard and additional features, what is possible in private law may not be self-evident in public law). Fundamental views on the division between public and private law. The sources of law, its structure and variation - what are the sources, where to look and what are their relationships to each other. What must a judge be guided by in making his or her decision? What are the people to be driven by? 6. Normativity as a fundamental feature of law: the legal norm. What is a legal norm, how does a legal norm behave? Why are rules so important? Regulating only what can be met and what can be enforced. What must all be observed to be a legal norm? Principles and rules. Modes of normativity and how to work with them: command, prohibition, permission, their relationship to each other and what does it imply. The existence of a legal norm (especially concerning time): how does the law operate over time? When does it come into existence? Does it disappear spontaneously, or does it always need a power impulse? Can it perform in the past? 7. Legal liability, legal punishment: what is a legal liability, and why is it necessary to be very careful in determining it? What are the principles of punishment? The law can do things. We say something, and it happens: it has a consequence, which is typically at the level of the virtual (I have some intangible right) but also at the level of the real (I have to stay in a closed building for a long time, I have to give/return something to someone, etc.). For these purposes, law constructs some facts as \"legal\". The law also responds to situations where I do not behave as it expects me to. I am \"responsible\" for some facts that happened, sometimes directly caused by me, sometimes not. And sometimes, I may not have intended to do so at all. How does the law construct this responsibility? Why can I be liable even if I did nothing? Can we condemn even someone we are not entirely sure if he did it? What doubts are permissible, and why is it better to release a criminal than lock up an innocent person? How is it possible for a person to be set free if everyone knows he is a criminal? 8. How is law made? Why is it such a problem to write the law well and clearly? Is there a difference between a good idea and the ability to express it when the villains are against it? What is clarity anyway? What are the requirements for lawmaking? What are all the things that must be taken into account when making law? Who all interferes, and who should interfere? Can we (should we) regulate everything, or is it unnecessary? The most common mistakes in lawmaking. Why such a long lawmaking process makes sense? 9. How do we find meaning in law? Is the law just what we see and read in the law? Why can two lawyers have two to four different views of a sentence? Is this wrong? Can't something be done about it? What is legal interpretation anyway, and what are its secrets? Does persuasion play a role in the process of interpreting the law? How does all of the above play out in interpretation, and why is it a fundamental legal discipline? What are the primary methods of interpreting the law, and why are there so many contradictions between them? Is there anything strange about legal thinking, or is it just a schematization of the usual human thinking when reading any text? 10. How is the law applied? How do legal proceedings work, why can they be so long, who all intervenes, and why do they take so many different forms? Fact-finding - why it is crucial to find out what happened. What is the role of truth when we sometimes hear that everyone is lying? Evidence and its peculiarities. What is a fair trial? Does the court create new facts, or does it just tell it like it thinks it was? What are the parts of a judgment or how to read a decision? Where does case law come from, and what is it? What about precedent? 11. Natural and positive law: relationships, ratios, conflicts. What is natural law, and why does it make sense to look at it? Is the law just a form, or can we sometimes expect goodness and justice from it? Where does natural law come from? Can we see it, and does it have anything to do with natural law? What is positive law concerning natural law? How does natural law behave, and when can it be taken into account? Are there any values in law at all? Can anything be done when the law is disgusting? And how do we know if it is repugnant? How do we behave when the legal system is breaking down, and why do we prefer not to imagine it at all? Can marriage endure when the legal system breaks down? 12. Justice: what is justice, and does it have any place in law? What are all the things to take into account when trying to decide fairly? Why is injustice sometimes permissible? How is it possible for a decision to be unfair but still right: do courts decide fairly or rightly? Doesn't justice make the law too complicated for us? How is it possible that we may not see a just solution at first sight? ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The course \u201eLegal Thinking\u201c is aimed at introducing the specifics of legal thinking. It introduces the different thought-forms in which law is expressed and shows what is essential for legal evaluation and the existence of law in society. The focus of the course is not on the particulars of legal disciplines but the overall understanding of law as a particular form of thought and a particular social system. The course introduces students to the peculiarities of legal reasoning. It will introduce them to areas usually conceptualized differently in society or ordinary discourse than in the sphere of law. Students will learn about legal reasoning, its principles and elements that are relevant to them. The aim of the course, on the other hand, is not to create definitions and classifications (which we cannot do without here either), but to show through problems that even legal reasoning, which at first sight seems inappropriate, has its meaning. Therefore, students will not be able to decide on legal cases and fully understand the legal system, but they will gain insight into its peculiarities. It also involves learning that legal thinking is not different from ordinary human thinking. It just happens in a different context. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course Work, Law and Modern Society is aimed at introducing current issues that permeate employment law. In particular, these are topics addressed at the level of the European Union, which have subsequently entered and continue to enter into national legislation. The European Union focuses its attention on topics that modern EU society calls for. The course is therefore not primarily designed as a basic course in labour law, but is aimed at providing up-to-date information on a wide range of topics that will be useful to the students in their future work as employers or employees. Students will learn about how work is regulated for the so-called delivery and taxi services, what rules protect young people in the workplace and during student work experience, they will also be introduced to situations in which employees are most at risk, for example, and will be explained the tools available to protect employees. Attention will be focused on a very topical subject, which is the issue of anti-discrimination law, which will permeate several sessions. Instruments representing protection against (sexual) harassment in the workplace will not be left out. The course will also introduce students to the rules that apply specifically to selected categories of employees, such as pregnant employees, parents caring for young children, etc. They will also gain an overview of the special laws regulating certain specific professions (teachers, academics, doctors, civil servants, etc.). They will also learn about the employment of foreigners, regulated mainly by the Employment Act, collective labour law, regulated by the Collective Bargaining Act, and the payment of insurance premiums, regulated by social security law. The course is aimed at a practical understanding of the topics in order to acquire long-term knowledge of the (instruments used to) protect employees. On the other hand, less attention will be focused on the knowledge of definitions and concepts. For this reason, the lectures will be continuously supplemented with activating activities that will strengthen the students  ability to remember information as well as the ability to navigate the legislation and understand the possibilities for solving specific problems. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " This course can be studied without fulfilling any special requirements. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Ongoing reflection. Peer review. Closed-question test. Presentation of the topic with discussion. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " As already indicated, the lectures will be interwoven with dialogue with students and their active participation will be ensured, especially through voting applications. Based on the results received, a discussion will take place. Teaching will also be supported through sub-assignments in the interactive curriculum and students will be challenged to think about the topics in a reflective way. Therefore, an interactive curriculum will be developed for the course aimed at developing learners' ability to think critically about topics and to promote deeper retention of topics. An anonymous online questionnaire will be made available to students to provide feedback during the course of their studies. ",

        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " The graduate of the course will therefore know the basics of relevant legislation regulating the performance of work related to modern society, the rights and obligations of the parties to the employment relationship, will be able to qualify the actual agency and know who to turn to in adverse situations.

        "SYLLABUS": " The course will consist of three parts. 1. Tax theory and tax law - in this most concise part, students will be theoretically introduced to the basic concepts in the given area necessary for practical understanding of the material; especially for future political scientists, sociologists, and other concerned professions, the material is also suitable for their further study of their mother disciplines; an integral part is also an interpretation of the role of European law for domestic legal regulation. 2. Substantive tax law - this part focuses on individual taxes that students may come into contact with during their studies and after graduation (personal income tax, social security contributions, health insurance premiums, corporate income tax, property tax, road tax, VAT, excise duties, local and other taxes, etc. The student will learn how to optimize taxes, calculate his/her own tax liability for selected taxes, practically use information systems related to tax returns (My Taxes portal), file tax returns and related reports and pay his/her tax obligations, including insurance premiums. 3. Procedural tax law - students will be acquainted with the rights and obligations arising from the Tax Code and other tax laws in tax proceedings when dealing with tax authorities, social security authorities and health insurance companies; each student will be able to act before these authorities as an informed tax subject aware of his/her rights and obligations at all stages of tax proceedings. The individual teaching blocks and what the student will take away from them: 1. Tax law (MR): What is tax law? What is its relationship to other legal and non-legal branches? Why is it necessary to know tax law and what is self-application? What is the tax law system? 2. Tax theory (MR): What is tax? What is the difference between a tax and a fee? Who pays taxes? For what? On what value? How much? To whom? When? Where does the tax revenue go? 3. Employee taxation (MR): How does an employee pay taxes? What levies must the employee pay?

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course aims to provide students with a basic overview of taxes, tax law and taxation. It will deal in more detail with those taxes with which the average person - student, employee, small businessman - comes into contact. The purpose of the course is to draw the attention of non-lawyers in particular to their tax obligations, both during their studies and after graduation, regardless of whether they are employed or go into self-employment. The course will cover selected taxes including practical aspects related to their calculation and completion of tax returns. We will look in detail at taxation of income from employment, business, rent, etc. We will also look at taxation of property (houses, flats, cars, etc.), including property transfers (inheritance, donation, purchase and sale of real estate), and differences in taxation of corporations. Finally, we will also outline how value added tax and selective excise duties (alcohol, tobacco, etc.) work. Local taxes (dogs, waste, etc.) cannot be ignored either. In addition to calculating taxes, every university educated person should also be able to deal with the tax office on basic matters. Therefore, we will also focus on the rights and obligations in tax proceedings (with an emphasis on the issues of tax inspections and evidence). The course has the ambition to prepare each student for the most common and most frequent situations in life related to tax obligations so that he/she is able to be oriented in them, to apply tax law to himself/herself (to fill in tax returns and reports, to calculate his/her tax obligation and to pay tax/insurance premiums) and to act in negotiations before the tax administrator and similar state administration bodies. The knowledge given can then save time and money for representation by a tax advisor or attorney, regardless of the field of study and after graduation from MUNI. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course content covers seminal financial developments in a diverse set of countries \u2013 with a special focus on the EU \u2013 in the last century. Reaching across the chronological arc of the course there are three broad topics: (1) tax and accounting principles, (2) financial markets and instruments regulation, and (3) financial behavior. Although nearly every case touches all three topics, each case also has its primary focus. Whereas some cases highlight the developments of EU tax regulation, the introduction of new financial markets or creation of new instruments (such as crypto-currencies), others trace the emergence and maturation of critical financial institutions (including banks and insurance companies). Still, some focus on the behavior of financial actors and groups, particularly in the context of tax changes or financial crisis. As the course highlights the origins of financial markets and instruments as well as the fallout from numerous financial crises, government also plays major role in many of the cases. Throughout the course, the goal is to provide students with the broadest possible grounding in the real world of finance by exposing them to some of the greatest (and, at times, most devastating) moments in the modern financial history. Although the past is unlikely to repeat itself exactly, legal scholars who have a strong background in financial history are likely to be better prepared for the full diversity of financial innovations, shocks, and crises that they will face in the future.

The course contains an overview of the rules of civil procedure ranging from the commencement of proceedings to defining issues for trial, and to enforcement of judgments from the international and European point of view. It covers information about the UNIDROIT Projects (Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure, European Rules of Civil Procedure and Effective Enforcement) and an introduction to the theory and policy of insolvency law, and to its fundamental principles. There is a particular emphasis upon case management procedures adopted by courts and various alternative dispute resolution mechanisms which are used to resolving civil disputes without recourse to a contested hearing and judgment by a court. Attention is paid to the commercial arbitration and dispute resolution. This course provides an understanding of general principles of international arbitration, how arbitration is conducted, relevant procedural framework (jurisdiction, composition tribunal, hearing), determination of the applicable substantive law, enforcement of arbitration across the border, and the comparison of the main alternative dispute resolution processes (arbitration, mediation and adjudication).

        "SYLLABUS": " Lesson 1: Intersystemic regulation under international law This regulation cannot be coherently discussed without a strict distinction between general international law (customary or codified) and particularized (treaty) international law. The former forms a \"vault\" over all unique systems (national law) or particularistic systems (integration law or Union law). General international law is therefore called upon to unilaterally direct the conduct of all other legal orders, and thus to disregard the legal nature of any one of them. A fundamental element of the international law regulation of intersystemic relations is thus the principle of exclusion (the inadmissibility of national law), which disregards the normative effects of systems of national and EU law. The treaty systems of particular international law may derogate from the intersystemic regulation of general international law (lex specialis derogat generali), e.g. by providing for the immediate effects of international treaties within states.\n    Lesson 2: Intersystemic regulation established by national law V the interest of unique systems of national law is to achieve harmony with systems of general and particular international law. In the contexts of the vertical system of national law, regulation is generally carried out in its top \"tier\", i.e., the constitution. The principle of incorporation (reception of general and/or particular international law) has become a fundamental element of constitutional regulation of intersystemic relations. This diversifies the effects of international law and its implementation, since specific intersystemic regulation inevitably differs in  individual unique national legal orders. This constitutional practice results in the fragmentation and destabilization of the effects of the international law principle of the inadmissibility of national law and, as a consequence, in the complete amputation of these effects in the constitutional plane of national law or, in the extreme case, even in the legislative plane (so-called treaty override).\n    Lesson 3: Intersystemic regulation under EU law Integration (Union) law represents a particularistic legal system which, on the one hand, in relation to unique national legal orders, appears as a common system to be unilaterally reciprocated by them, whereas, on the other hand, in terms of international law, it appears as a unique system which cannot be invoked in competition with the latter. The incorporation of EU law by the constitutions of some Member States results in its domestication, which has been described in the past in the doctrines of \"so lange\", \"ultra vires\" or \"constitutional identity\". These fundamentally clash with the fundamental principle of the primacy of EU law, as enshrined in EU law. In relation to international law, a distinction must be made between the mere autonomy of EU law in relation to general international law (which is therefore not reciprocated by EU law, but is applicable in that law without further application by virtue of the lex generalis title), and to articular international law, in relation to which EU law claims full independence, resulting in its unilateral incorporation (reception) under the conditions which EU law itself unilaterally lays down. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The emergence and existence of the legal order are based on an independent political power that determines the social values it protects and the vertical or horizontal stratification of these values within the legal order. Therefore, the relations between legal orders are inevitably characterised by their mutual independence, which excludes the possibility of a certain uniform intersystemic legal regulation (the so-called meta-law). In the absence of a meta-rule, the relevant legal order is always called upon to regulate its relations with other legal orders by unilateral regulation of its own norms. Such unilateral regulation introduces \"order\" into the coexistence of legal systems, i.e. harmony, judged from the point of view of the given regulating legal order, but at the same time disharmony, judged from the point of view of other legal orders which are subject to its unilateral normative regulation. The question of the relations between legal systems cannot, for the reason given, be treated in a general and unified manner, but always only through the lens of each of the legal systems concerned (international, national and integration [EU] law). This corresponds to the specific intersystemic regulations based on 1) international law; 2) national law; 3) integration [EU] law, which in the end requires three lessons in the teaching of the doctoral programme in question.

The ability to formulate independent legal positions, whether in agreement or disagreement, will be evaluated. Additionally, students are required to actively participate in the final group seminar, engage in discussions, and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the selected subtopic of the monograph. For the presentation on a topic with an EU-related focus, adherence to the time limit (15 minutes), coherence in expression, and particularly accuracy in presenting the subject matter will be assessed. The ability to respond to questions from the audience and the capability to present detailed legal arguments for addressing the selected issue will also be evaluated. ",

        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Students during the semester: Based on their selection, students will study a chosen monograph in detail. Their task is not only to read the book but also to: a) actively ask themselves questions while reading and search for answers (and record them), b) take notes on key ideas, c) record moments when they experienced an \"aha\" moment, d) formulate theses for academic debate, and e) note insights that can be utilized in their own dissertation work. With these prepared notes, students will attend at least one individual consultation with the instructor during the semester (ideally during the instructor's office hours). At the end of the semester (on November 28, 2024, at 3:00 PM), they will participate in a mandatory joint academic seminar with the instructor and other students of the course, where key aspects of the topics will be discussed. Students must bring a written detailed elaboration of a selected legal issue related to the studied publication to this meeting. They should be able to present the issue's solution and respond to feedback from others. The duration of the seminar will depend on the number of students enrolled in the course that semester. Students, working in pairs, will study selected employment law matters originating from the European Union. According to their own choice, they may select either: a) the legal regulation of whistleblowing, b) the legal regulation of work for digital platforms, c) the legal regulation of collective redundancies, d) the legal regulation of employer insolvency, e) the legal regulation of working hours and rest periods, f) the legal regulation of the right to disconnect, g) the legal regulation of on-call work, h) the legal regulation of the transfer of rights and obligations, or i) specific legal regulations in the area of anti-discrimination (employment) law. Other topics may be agreed upon with the instructor. The selected topic will a) be briefly introduced in a presentation at a joint meeting at the end of the semester. However, the key part of the presentation will be b) identifying a specific legal issue related to the de lege lata regulation and primarily c) presenting extensive arguments leading to its resolution.

        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " The course ends with a colloquium, in which the student and the supervisor discuss the prepared review. The review must meet the appropriate professional parameters - it must not be a mere annotation, a description of the content of the publication, nor should it be an advertising message recommending the purchase of the publication. It is recommended to avoid common mistakes, such as structuring the text mechanically according to the chapters of the reviewed monograph and only descriptively summarizing the content that is presented in the individual chapters. Such a (pseudo)review is unlikely to be published in any quality journal. A review should be a professional text in its own right, in which its author can provide a critical view of the various parameters of the reviewed publication, including its systematics, its focus and breadth of coverage, methodology, level of expertise, depth of argumentation, usefulness of conclusions, breadth and representativeness of sources used, clarity, readability and readability, etc. Often, it also provides a confrontation with other published works in the field (it is therefore quite common to work with other expert sources in a review) and puts the topics discussed in a broader context.

The particular specialization will be arranged individually. The purpose of the course is to familiarize postgraduate students with methods of conducting a research of legal historical sources of historical secondary literature, practice of courts and possibly primary sources. Alongside that, they will be alerted to methodological issues which they will have to deal with in particular historical periods.

The first part of the course (i.e. interactive lectures) deals with topics such as research in law, plurality of approaches for studying law, empirical legal research - quantitative methods, empirical legal research \u2013 conducting interviews and their interpretation, interdisciplinarity in law, combining doctrinal approach with quantitative and qualitative methods, and comparison in law \u2013 how to select cases for case-study research design. Lectures will be followed by interactive seminars allowing students to present their dissertation projects. Subsequently, presented projects will be discussed and revised by their authors. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of the course is to introduce the application of social sciences methods in legal academic writing. The courses addresses these issues: What are the questions solved by the legal science? How to answer them? How to conduct an empirical research in law? The course follows two aims: First, to broaden the knowledge of students about various approaches to legal research and second, to prepare them for their work on dissertation theses, offering them a forum for the dissertation project presentation. It introduces students into principles of legal research, argumentation, and rules of academic scholarship applicable in their dissertation and other academic scholarly works. It shows how to combine classic doctrinal and normative approaches to law with empirical research, while presenting a more sophisticated research designs (case study, comparative study), and most commonly used qualitative and quantitative methods (experiment, structured interview, content analysis, survey, experiment, etc.). The students are expected to learn how to create a research design, set research questions or hypotheses, how to proceed with their verification, how to process the data and identify suitable methods for a given research. The second part of the course enables the students to try out new skills when presenting their own dissertation projects. Each student works with a mentor who consults her or his research project. The student subsequently present their dissertation project in individual seminars. The workshop part of the course is concluded by individual consultations or focus groups. ",

It includes participation in the organizational and content preparation of teaching and teaching materials and participation in the organizational and content preparation and implementation of examinations, but especially preparation for and then the actual involvement in direct teaching under the mentorship of an authorized academic staff member, so that students are gradually able to independently conduct teaching, usually in an area more broadly related to the topic of the dissertation or chosen specialization in the field. To this end, the student seeks and receives feedback and responds to it. The student's involvement in direct teaching is normally preceded first by passive participation (listening in on lessons), participation in lesson preparation and consultation on lesson content. It is also preceded by an analysis of the student's baseline level of competence, so that specific activities can be targeted to develop those competences that a particular student needs to develop most.

At the end of the course a student will be able of direct instruction in both, the master degree programme and the bachelor degree programme. The content of the course includes activities of a pedagogical nature that enable students to acquire and develop pedagogical competences and give them access to experience with the pedagogical process in an academic workplace. The aim is to actively try out these activities, to get to know them, to contribute to the development of the relevant competences on the basis of the experience gained, and to be able to receive and perceive feedback and draw from it appropriate steps for further improvement.

It is recommended to avoid common mistakes, such as structuring the text mechanically according to the chapters of the reviewed monograph and only descriptively summarizing the content that is presented in the individual chapters. Such a (pseudo)review is unlikely to be published in any quality journal. A review should be a professional text in its own right, in which its author can provide a critical view of the various parameters of the reviewed publication, including its systematics, its focus and breadth of coverage, methodology, level of expertise, depth of argumentation, usefulness of conclusions, breadth and representativeness of sources used, clarity, readability and readability, etc. Often, it also provides a confrontation with other published works in the field (it is therefore quite common to work with other expert sources in a review) and puts the topics discussed in a broader context.

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " A condition for access to the exam is (in addition to attending the mandatory seminars) the preparation of a seminar paper analyzing a specific theoretical and legal problem in a judicial decision of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court, or explaining the solution of a \"practical\" case. A seminar paper of 1,600 - 2,000 characters (including spaces) will focus only on the theoretical legal problem. It will completely ignore the facts (except where necessary for the theoretical analysis, e.g. in the case of evidence). Students may only draw on a pre-given list of admissible judicial decisions. If it is a practical solution, they will concentrate on explaining the procedure and reasons for the particular solution. The seminar paper aims to prepare learners for the essay, which is part of the examination and tests their ability to apply theoretical terms and concepts independently. The objectives thus focus on understanding, application, analysis and evaluation: The student should demonstrate the use of legal theory concepts, describe concepts and elements, identify the place of features in the systematics of legal thinking, express legal theory concepts and communicate the content of ideas in their own words; demonstrate legal theory concepts through practical examples (court decisions), interpret concepts, generalize knowledge from examples, describe the relationships between concepts and apply them to solve examples; Identify relationships between legal theory concepts, analyze and identify connections, categorize areas of legal theory and discuss terms and concepts using a selected example (court decision); assess the correctness of the application of theoretical concepts, compare the practical outcome with the theoretical definition and justify any deviations and correspondences. The following condition for access to the exam is to pass a simple machine-corrected test consisting of five questions (any answer can be correct. It is necessary to pass 60%). The test aims to determine whether the student remembers the legal theory terms and concepts of legal theory and can define the terms used, list their elements and terms and identify their characteristics.\n\n    The examination consists of a test of theoretical knowledge and an essay (thesis). The first part (the test of theoretical knowledge) consists of answering five open questions, i.e. questions that must be answered in one sentence, not in one sentence, but in a logically coherent explanation that relates exclusively to the questions asked. The answer must not only be factually correct but must also make logical and linguistic sense. It is necessary to exhaust the question, including its sub-questions (answering them is part of the assessment). The aim is to determine the ability to remember, understand and apply the content of the legal theory discussed. For preparation for the form of this part of the examination, serve discussion at seminars and answer the questions asked there.\n\n    The second part focuses on writing an essay, the essence of which is a theoretical definition of selected legal concepts, institutes or problems, using exclusively expert sources. The aim is to determine the students' ability to apply, analyse and evaluate theoretical concepts in practical contexts. Seminar papers are mainly used to prepare for this part of the examination.\n\n    The length of the test is 20 minutes. Each question can be scored 0-4 points. The essay is 45 minutes for a maximum of 30 points. The final grade will be the sum of the points obtained in both parts. (50-47 A; 46-43 B; 42-39 C; 38-35 D; 34-30 E; 29-0 F) ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Teaching/Learning takes the form of lectures and seminars. Lectures emphasize the theoretical preparation of students. Lectures are followed by seminar exercises focused on the practical application of the acquired knowledge, including understanding fundamental categories, relationships and legal thinking. In the seminar groups, students will solve model situations and discuss the possibilities of applying theoretical and meta-concepts to practical examples (including court decisions). Seminar classes deepen the learning: understanding the material by further explanation and searching for the meaning of particular divisions or limitations necessary for law. It serves to enable learners to come to an understanding of the various parts of legal theory through their reflections and by discovering the multiple elements of law. This is also done by analyzing some court decisions (in particular, finding out why the court decided in a specific way and the meaning of the decision) and solving practical (concrete; model) examples.\n    Self-study and study of the required literature are also part of the teaching methods.

        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " Knowledge of Theory of Law I. ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Attendance with up to one absence is required to complete the course. In the case of another absence, a student must prepare a seminar paper(s) according to the teacher's conditions or meet other requirements. In the case of unexcused absences more significant than 50%, the student will be graded with an X. Students are obliged to prepare for the seminars, familiarise themselves with the relevant materials listed in the interactive syllabus, and solve the assigned examples in the seminar.\n    As the seminars will involve simulated court proceedings, learners must divide into three working groups and participate in the group work, including contributing to submitting written assignments.\n    The simulation aims to acquire the ability to apply the theoretical and methodological aspects of law acquired, analyse a specific legal problem, handle it methodologically, and evaluate reality based on the theoretical methodology.\n    Seminar paper: report of a court hearing. Another condition for successful course completion is preparing a seminar paper (a court hearing notice). The student must participate in a hearing before a court anywhere in the Czech Republic (participation in one hearing is sufficient; it is optional to participate in the entire court proceedings). The student will draw up a record of this hearing with the obligatory structure: identification of the court, identification of the type of proceedings, identification of the stage of the proceedings, date; description of the event: what happened during the hearing (e.g. these events are presented in a reportorial form: it is not about the exact legal grasp and description of the events but about their outward appearance. How the hearing was concluded: how the hearing was concluded (decision to adjourn, adjournment, final judgment or order, etc.) The length of the seminar paper is a maximum of 2 pages (3,600 characters) - depending on the type of hearing or proceedings.\n    The last condition for proper course completion is a written test of knowledge. The test will consist of 5 open-ended questions reflecting the various topics discussed, including mastery of terminology, ability to reason, combine and certify the ability to use terminology and basic methods. Each answer will be scored 0-4 points. A score of at least 12 (at least 60%) will be required to pass. After failing, the paper may be taken in a maximum of two further attempts.\n    The test aims to test the ability to remember the elements of general legal methodology, understand the legal methodology, apply the theoretical framework of legal methodology, analyse the methods and techniques of law and evaluate legal methodology. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Lectures, seminars, solving examples, simulations.\n    Lectures are used to introduce theoretical concepts, theories, concepts of methods and techniques used in the general legal methodology.\n    Seminars serve to deepen the teaching: understanding the material by further explanation, searching for the meaning of particular divisions or limitations that are necessary for law. They help students understand the different parts of legal methodology through their reflections and by discovering the various methods and techniques. The analysis of some court decisions and the solution of practical (concrete) examples and a simulated game of court proceedings are also used for this purpose. ",
        "TEACHER_INFO": " ",
        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " After completing the course, the student will be able: to work with the concepts of legal language and the specifics of legal language; to use selected techniques of law-making in the legislative process; to describe the methodological aspect of the process of interpretation of law and to distinguish individual methods and techniques concerning the possibilities and limits of their use; to explain the individual steps of the process of authoritative application of law, including subsumption; to identify the general requirements for fact-finding in the process of authoritative application of law; to analyse the structure and content of legal argumentation; to analyse case law and explain the process of its formation.

They are based on syllabuses: part one is more theoretical (topics for discussion) and part two is more practical (cases). One time a term the students solve the real case based on the petition, courts recording, decision, opinion of an expert witness, etc.). Everything is available on the information system. The students work on active skills (drills), good written and oral self-presentation. They participate in class discussions. Students understand better the problematic, remember the key institutions and use them in praxis. ",

In the course of the Labour Law II course, students should acquire the essential aspects of the legal regulation of individual labour relations in particular areas, as well as basic skills applicable in labour law practice. Thus, the course will guide students through the legal aspects of the employment relationship from its establishment to its termination, including issues related to changes in the employment relationship, remuneration of dependent work, working and rest periods, holidays, obstacles at work, the obligation to compensate for injury, etc. The course will also reflect the specifics of the legal regulation of flexible employment relationships, in particular those based on agreements on work performed outside the employment relationship. In the skills seminar, emphasis will be placed on deepening students' argumentation and application skills and on developing their ability to work critically with sources of law and especially with case law.

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course focuses on commercial obligations, especially commercial contracts. The aim of the course is to broaden the basic knowledge of contract law and to develop skills so that students are able to deal with complex cases they may encounter in legal practice. This is not only about knowledge of the legal regulation of individual institutes, but also their complex interrelation from a functional perspective across different areas of regulation, complemented by typical contractual solutions. At the same time, the subject matter of the course also includes certain types of contracts that are not discussed in civil law (e.g. contract for work, commercial agency, letter of credit, collection, credit, transport, forwarding, storage, etc. ) To a limited extent, the teaching will also focus on the acquisition of passive and active contracting skills - analysis and creation of contractual arrangements (there is not enough space for the creation of entire contracts in the basic course, but in the next semester we offer a follow-up elective course MVD029K).

        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Completion of the seminars requires continuous preparation and performance of tasks according to the assignment of the teacher. The course is completed by a written comprehensive examination, which includes not only the syllabus of the subject Commercial Law III, but also verifies the ability to connect knowledge in the whole area of commercial law, i.e. it includes all the syllabus of the subjects Commercial Law I-III. A prerequisite for access to the examination is obtaining credits in Business Law I and II; a prerequisite is also fulfilling the obligations in the Business Law III seminar course and obtaining access to the examination from the seminar teacher. Credit may be given for excellent results in Business Law I and II and in the Business Law III seminar course. Since the curriculum builds to a large extent on the knowledge already acquired in civil law, a good knowledge of the statutory regulations is assumed, especially the general part of the law of obligations (\u00a7 1721-2054 of the Civil Code), the general part of civil law (especially \u00a7 1-22, 30, 118-213, 489, 492, 495-501, 510-514, 545-589, 600-654, 976-978, 1099-1133 of the Civil Code), of the contractual types, in particular the basics of the contract of sale (\u00a72079-2156 of the Civil Code), order, commission and mediation (\u00a72430-2470 of the Civil Code), the basics of compensation for damages (\u00a72894-2919, 2951-2955, 2969 of the Civil Code) and unjust enrichment (\u00a72991-3005 of the Civil Code). Due to the inseparable thematic continuity, knowledge of this textbook is also necessary for the purposes of Commercial Law III and can be the subject of the Commercial Law III examination. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Teaching takes the form of lectures (once a week) and seminars (once a week). The lectures have a cognitive purpose, while the seminars are designed to practice especially the ability to apply legal regulations to specific situations and to develop other skills and abilities. In the seminars, specific examples are solved and discussed, which are given in advance. ",

",
        "OBJECTIVES": " Mining law is an interdisciplinary area of law because it uses both public and private law methods of legal regulation. In doing so, it also uses knowledge from various branches of law (in particular administrative law, environmental law, civil law). The institutions of mining law and their application are very closely linked to knowledge of the geology of mineral deposits, methods of extraction and the elimination of their impact on the environment, including the financial costs of the implementation of these activities. The course is intended primarily for students of the Faculty of Law, for whom it will enable them to deepen their knowledge of other subjects - e.g. land and civil law or environmental law. The target group is also students of other faculties that deal with the issue of mineral exploitation from non-legal (substantive) aspects: mainly students of the Faculty of Science. ",

A central part of the teaching will be seminars, where practical and model cases dealing with legal issues in the prospecting and exploitation of mineral deposits and the remediation of the consequences of mining will be solved through discussion. Students will prepare solutions to the examples before the seminar. Classes will be taught in four-hour blocks once a fortnight . The block always includes a lecture and a seminar. In total, the course will consist of 14 hours of lectures and 12 hours of seminars. The teaching will also include an excursion to a site in the vicinity of Brno, where mining and the removal of the consequences of mineral extraction are taking place. As part of the excursion, the basic issues of mining and mineral processing, solutions to reclamation of the area and economic issues will be professionally explained and documented by the representatives of the practice. The students will also get acquainted with the legal documents on the basis of which mining is carried out. Direct acquaintance with the history and consequences of mining activities will enable a better and more effective understanding of the relevant legislation (material sources of law) and its application. The e-learning is provided with an interactive syllabi, background materials in electronic form and links to various (also media) publicly available resources in electronic form. ",

While in the past, taxation used to be considered mainly a national affair, globalization necessitates coordination of policy and practice among countries, to achieve goals such as due allocation of revenues, counterfeiting tax avoidance and tax evasion, the prevention of unfair tax competition and tax system abuse for criminal and terrorist purposes.\n\n    Israel \u2013 a small country highly depending on international trade, is highly exposed to these risks.\n\n    The course will examine the manners in which taxation may facilitate international trade, or rather impose barriers to it. It will explore the motivation behind the latter practice, introducing national, regional and multilateral legal instruments developed to prevent this result.\n    The course will introduce to the students basic concepts and rules of international taxation, developed in the national and international sphere, referring, among other things, to OECD, WCO and WTO rules, and critically examine the ways in which these norms and instruments are implemented in Israel.

Judiciary of the EU = Court of Justice + General Court + national courts. The importance of understanding the multi-level system of judicial protection in the EU. 2. How to read EU case law? Assigned reading of two cases of the Court of Justice, one case of the General Court and one case of a national court dealing with an issue of EU law. Assignment: prepare case briefs for all cases read and find your own method of annotating case-law. 3. References for a preliminary ruling: a dialogue of courts or a monologue of the Court of Justice? 4. Identify three \u201cstories\u201d of preliminary ruling procedure in any given field. In each story, read: (A) national court\u2019s reference to the ECJ, (B) the ECJ\u2019s ruling, (C) national court\u2019s follow-up decision. Think about the procedure as a whole and make observations. Assignment: a short position paper summarising your observations after having read 3x3 judicial decisions. 5. References for a preliminary ruling: stakeholders, strategies, methods, and the ECJ\u2019s monopoly on the interpretation of EU law. 6. Pick an area of EU law (citizenship, free movement, competition, consumer, criminal, environment, employment, non-discrimination, anything). Identify 3 most important cases of the past decade, read them and annotate them (incl. case briefs). Then, try to find out whether national courts apply these cases in their decision-making. Assignment: prepare a written submission to a national court of your choice, using EU law (and CJEU case-law) in your argumentation. Persuade the national court that EU law is highly relevant in the case at hand and that it should either be applied directly, or a preliminary reference should be made to the ECJ. 7. Who can help me with this? National courts and two different (yet, similar) mechanisms: preliminary references to the ECJ vs. constitutionality review to the national constitutional court. 8. Read a couple of cases in a chosen area where constitutional law meets EU law (asylum, non-discrimination, labour\u2026). This time you are a national court, facing parallel issues of constitutionality and EU conformity. Assignment: draft a reference, either to your constitutional court, or to the ECJ, explain the conformity issue and ask for help. 9. Direct actions to the CJEU: action for annulment, action for failure to act, infringement action, 10. Pick one of the other types of proceedings and study the relevant academic literature. Depending on your own preference, draft either a submission of a non-privileged party to the General Court (AA, AFA), a submission of the Commission or another MS to the Court of justice (IA), or draft an AG opinion or a judgment in any case that is currently pending before the CJEU. 11. The constitutional dimension of EU judicial proceedings. The EU and the MS constitutional courts. The EU and the European Court of Human Rights. Cooperation, rivalry, accession. 12. On the basis of detailed feedback on you previous assignment, please incorporate all the comments and re-draft your submission as a final submission for this course. 13. Feedback session on the final written assignment, revision, wrap-up, Q&A. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The main aim of the course is to familiarise students with the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the EU and with national court proceedings that have a European dimension. The course will offer a space for students with an interest in constitutional and European law to look in more detail at the different forms of proceedings before the CJEU. The primary focus of the course is the preliminary ruling procedure, which is spread between the national courts (which are the subject of the study of constitutional law) and the CJEU (which is primarily studied in European law). A strong emphasis will be placed on self-study and analysis of case law; the teaching in this course is 'blended', combining this self-study with face-to-face meetings designed to discuss, analyse and generalise the knowledge gained from the study of case law. The course is also open to Erasmus students and PhD students. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " This class will cover the law and drafting of international commercial contracts. We will begin examining the transactional process at the time a business person approaches their lawyer with the idea of creating an international business deal. This course is about how a lawyer researches, drafts, and negotiates the appropriate documentation for the transaction. It is a class about anticipating, recognizing, and providing solutions for some of the problems that may arise in the future. In the real world of contract practice, particularly in common law countries, there are numerous conflicting forces which a lawyer must recognize and learn to address. Acquiring the skills necessary to perform these tasks requires considerable practice.\n\n    As practitioners in the field well know, it is often only a small part of the drafting of any contract clause that is actually done from scratch unless the entire contract is one that deals with non-standard circumstances. Much of what is called \"drafting\" is usually the re-working or manipulating of the standard clauses that form the lawyer's collected lingua franca of contracts. And, as often as not, many of these clauses take on lives of their own, with the result that they are seldom carefully scrutinized and their bad drafting can thus replicate itself through subsequent contracts. A primary goal of this course, therefore, is to help you learn how to spot bad drafting, and to correct the problems such bad drafting creates. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " There will be a final paper for the course where you will be asked to draft a portion of an international commercial agreement. The paper which will count for 80% of your final grade. The remaining 20 % will be based on attendance and class participation.\n    Regular attendance in class is required. Excessive unexcused attendance may result in a reduction in the final grade and/or other disciplinary action. In the event that a significant development will prevent you from attending class sessions, please contact me. ",
        "TEACHING_METHODS": " Each class will be consisting of three primary elements: Lecture, reviewing and critiquing commercial documents, and drafting document clauses. ",
        "TEACHER_INFO": " ",
        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " As a result of taking this course, you should be able to:\n    1. Identify significant business and cultural considerations in drafting agreements for international transactions.\n    2. Recognize and understand fundamental legal principles that apply to international business transactions.\n    3. Recognize potential risks for your client in conducting international business and identify potential solutions to address such risk.\n    4. Be able to successfully draft clear, comprehensive agreements that advance the rights of your client. ",

Participants simulate international arbitration related to investment disputes between states and investors. The FDI Moot helps future lawyers attain a practical understanding of these issues. The case and hearings offer a unique forum for academics and practitioners from around the world to discuss developments - and assess emerging talents. International investment arbitration remains the most effective remedy for foreign investors to ensure that host States do not discriminate against them, treat them fairly, and with due process, and that host States keep their promises to foreign investors.

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course addresses legal problems of distribution of audiovisual content in the EU single market. The law of the single market is based on the fundamental freedoms, including the freedom to provide services. On of the objectives of the harmonization of national laws is to facilitate free provision of services, including audiovisual media services and information society services. During the course we discuss the instruments, such as the country of origin principle, that aim to ensure smooth cross-border provisions of programs. The approach developed in the EU originates from the world of television, particularly delivered by satellite and cable. With the advent of internet, information society services and digital channels of distribution, EU law expanded to other sectors: VOD and online platforms. Digital technologies also facilitate audiovisual piracy. The second problem addressed during the course are the attempts to limit and prevent the dissemination of content infringing copyright and related rights. In this area the course explains the applicability of copyright and related rights law to acts of content distribution, with the focus on audiovisual content. ",

        "SYLLABUS": " 1.THE HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE\n    In this section of the course, the emphasis will be on film and literature. The 20th and 21st centuries have been despoiled by mass and systematic murders. A profound issue is how can the perpetrators be held accountable. We will start with one of the most powerful short films of the Nazi Holocaust, \u201cNight and Fog\u201c by Alain Renais. Then we will consider \"The Investigation\" by German playwright Peter Weiss, based on actual trial transcripts of accused Nazi war criminals. Together, these materials address both the gravity of human barbarity and mechanisms and limitations of legal responsibility for crimes against humanity (and their relevance to the present). The film and the play should be seen and should be read outside class so that we can maximize discussion.\n\n    2. RESISTANCE TO UNJUST LEGAL AUTHORITY\n    Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, many feature films and documentaries have also treated legal themes directly and indirectly. These films are directly relevant to the Holocaust specifically and to genocide generally: When should individuals decide to disobey illegal and immoral orders? This time we will discuss the film \u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\u201d based on the novella by British author Alan Sillitoe. This should also be seen outside of class. We will examine this prize winning film that raises fundamental issues of ethical and social responsibility for lawyers, judges, and other legal personnel as well as for human beings generally when they confront unjust political circumstances. It also addresses issues of unjust conditions in juvenile prison conditions in the UK and elsewhere.\n\n    3. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: A MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY EXAMPLE\n    Women\u2019s reproductive rights have been contentious for centuries, including in Europe recently (and now) and in the U.S. at present since the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that there was no longer a constitutional right to abortion. In this final unit, we will compare a short French literary work with a very short recent American film. Students will read \"Happening\" by Nobel-Prize winner Annie Ernaux and \u201cRed, White, and Blue\u201d by Nazrin Choudury (seen in class, 24 minutes). Both narratives chronicle the harrowing attempts to obtain abortions when they are illegal and the accompanying human implications when women and their health care providers must decide to obey or not obey the law. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " The humanities offer multiple perspectives on law and legal issues. Artists working in several media have dealt with a variety of legal themes. Often, they have used their creative abilities to provide commentary and criticism about judges, courts, and many other legal institutions while providing broader observations about deeper human issues of ethics and morality. This mini-course will examine selected examples of film and literature in various cultures. Throughout our time, we will examine and discuss some powerful issues showing how films and literary works raise serious and troubling issues that have affected millions of people during the past century. We will focus in particular on how traditional humanistic source materials can provide valuable intellectual and ethical stimuli for members and prospective members of the legal profession. ",

        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Students will write an essay of approximately one/two pages online offering their personal reactions to whichever materials or topics covered in class that they find most important or personally engaging.

        "SYLLABUS": " 1. Gender, Feminism and Law\n    Legal feminism draws attention in both theoretical and practical ways to the presumptions and structures that underpin law and legal theory. Here we will examine the theoretical arguments raised by legal feminists. This seminar focuses on the role that feminism has played, and more recently queer theory, as bodies of scholarly work which aim to help us think about and achieve gender equality and what we mean by gender equality in that context. Feminism and Queer theory offer theoretical, methodological and practical tools which will underpin discussions across this course. We will introduce feminist and queer thought and discuss different variations and histories. We will then look to explore the role of gender in detail, before finally discussing current issues today and dealing in the present with the treatment of women in the past.\n    2. Intersectionality, Poststructuralism and Posthumanism\n    This seminar focuses on three key elements of feminist theory and practice, strands of intersectionality, poststructuralism and posthumanism. This will aid in considering the rich array of contemporary feminist thought, why there is such diversity and its relationships to other aspects of legal theory and jurisprudence. It will also consider what future feminist legal concerns might be and how we might consider thinking about them.\n    3. Feminist Constitutionalism: Constitutional Change\n    In this seminar, we start to dive into constitutionalism and constitutional law and practice. In particular, we will be looking at the feminist debates on constitutionalism and feminist theories of constitutions. In this seminar, we will start to think about feminist approaches to constitutional change. In particular, we will reflect on what feminist approaches to constituent power might mean. Constituent power is the power to bring about constitutional change. It has traditionally been exercised by men, but there are contemporary and historical examples where women are active constituent power-holders. Moreover, feminist constitutional scholars are unearthing the ways in which women have participated as constituent-actors.\n    4. Speculative Feminist Constitutions (Manifestos, Utopias)\n    Women\u2019s dreams and aspirations for constitutional futures are conveyed in many different forms of communication. Women and feminist activists across history and around the world have used speculative and utopian literature as part of their political theorising. This seminar focuses on this use of speculative fiction and utopian thinking as a feminist praxis in constitutional change. We will learn about feminist manifestos and how these are used and understood as part of activism within constitutional change. We will critically engage with examples of these manifestos and examples of feminist speculative short-stories. In this seminar, we will engage in a zine-making exercise to develop experimental feminist manifestos.\n    5. Drafting a Feminist Constitution\n    There are numerous examples where women and feminist activists have drafted their own constitutions. Whether they are attempting to reject the formal state processes or are seeking to be included, these examples show us how it is possible to draft feminist constitutions. Examples include where women have organised mock Constituent Assemblies and written draft constitutions, such as in Australia, or in Bolivia, the \u2018Political, Feminist Constitution of the State: The Impossible Country We Build as Women\u2019 imagine an alternative state infrastructure, constitution-drafting process, and constitutional text. In this seminar, we will learn about feminist engagement with constitutional-drafting as well as engage in our own constitutional drafting exercises. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " In this course we will look at the interplay between gender, law and constitutions. We will introduce key theoretical approaches to law and gender, and law and intersectionality. These theoretical approaches will underpin the courses\u2019 focus on constitutional law and constitutional change. In particular, we will look at the impact of gender on constitutions and the impact constitutions have on gender. We will consider constitutional harm and evolution. We will introduce and engage with the expanding academic debates in feminist constitutionalism. We will consider examples where women and feminists have brought about constitutional change. This includes learning about and experimenting with feminist speculative and utopian praxis (through utopian short stories and through manifesto-writing). We will also consider what a feminist constitution might look like and mean, and we will have a go at drafting feminist constitutions. ",

        "SYLLABUS": " Initial Themes: We will begin with an overview of how literature is powerful source material for social, political, and legal analysis. Literary works, like the humanities in general, are valuable additions to the law school curriculum. I will identify several writers who addressed courts, legal processes, and the legal profession in their literary works. This sets the context for our treatment of Kafka\u2019s Trial.\n\n    I will briefly summarize some of his shorter works that address legal and related themes, including \u201cIn the Penal Colony,\u201d \u201cIn the Penal Colony,\u201d and \u201cMetamorphosis.\u201d These works address issues including the horror of many legal systems, terrifying bureaucracy, human alienation, and other themes that encourage readers (like lawyers) to reflect on their own lives and their professional obligations and responsibilities.\n\n    Continuing Substantive Discussions: This leads us to consider the label \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d This description applies to many features of modern life in the industrial world. The novel itself is an intriguing combination of a comedy, a satire, an allegory, a legal and political critique, and much more. We will then focus more specifically on the central and related questions: What is the \u201cLaw?\u201d What is the \u201cCourt System?\u201d What is the \u201ctrial\u201d being conducted against the central character K? Those issues will be part of our discussions in class.\n\n    As our class sessions continue, we will look closely at the text. We will consider how the central character, Joseph K., is caught in the Law\u2019s grip and how he is eventually crushed by it. A key issue is his \u201cpresumption of guilt,\u201d the opposite of the American and many other legal systems where criminal defendants are, formally, presumed innocent until proved guilty. Class discussions will focus on the text of the novel but also on its wider implications.\n\n    Throughout our sessions, we will consider the indifference of the judicial personnel that Kafka portrays in the novel as well as and K\u2019s lawyers like Dr. Huld. We will also discuss how so much of the law\u2014both criminal and civil\u2013\u2013has become unknowable and bureaucratic and entirely bewildering to ordinary people. What, then, does all this mean for lawyers and prospective lawyers? How can they work to improve communication for their clients and therefore the quality of their lives?\n\n    Final Discussions The course will conclude with the horrific but inevitable ending,\u201d Discussions will center around not only about the predetermined sentence for the main character of the novel, but the deeper implications for people (feeling or otherwise) trapped in the frustrating and mysterious bureaucratic legal, governmental, and commercial institutions. All of these are typically beyond their understanding, and lawyers can either worsen the situation or improve it.\n\n    We will discuss those questions and concerns, while urging students, more fundamentally, to make personal observations about their own lives and responsibilities in light of Franz Kafka\u2019s literary observations. ",
        "OBJECTIVES": " Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was one of the most powerful literary figures of the 20th century. A lifelong resident of Prague, he wrote in German and was educated there, receiving a law degree from the German branch of Charles University in 1906. He worked throughout his short adult life as a practicing lawyer at the Workmen\u2019s institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia in Prague. As a lawyer, he helped to bring about improvements in accident prevention for workers, among other responsibilities. Throughout his legal career, he wrote numerous documents beyond his literary masterpieces. I will read some short excerpts from his legal writings to reveal his technical knowledge and understanding of the law of his era. He was also fluent in Czech.\n\n    This mini-course is a follow-up to my earlier course on Kafka and the Law. There, we addressed several of Kafka\u2019s shorter writings in order to introduce Kafka in a law school setting and explore some of his themes that relate to law, the legal process, the judiciary, and the legal profession.\n\n    In the earlier course, it was not possible to delve into Kafka\u2019s classic novel The Trial because of the limitations of time. Here, however, the entire focus will be on that iconic work of literature. Franz Kafka, of course, addressed themes far beyond the law, and this course will touch upon some of them briefly, but most are beyond the scope of the present course. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The heritage of Roman law presents undoubtedly one of the sources of inspiration for many of the provisions of the present legal regulations. Observing Roman law influences in the domestic legal development should enable students to become familiar with the phenomenon of the so-called reception of Roman law, especially for the High Middle Ages with overlaps to modern times. The gradual penetration of Roman law in the Czech lands was created by a distinctive stamp of legal monuments of its time. Understanding these Roman law elements should students show how they influenced contemporary legislation, particularly in private law. The seminars will attempt to find the appropriate relationship between Roman law and legal-historical knowledge, which should lead students to independent thinking about the actual practical cases, the rules de lege ferenda and de lege lata. Students undergoing this course should gain a comprehensive overview of domestic ancient legal history, including understanding the context of the development of selected legal institutions. Emphasis will be placed on the ability to analyze source documents, the ability to ask appropriate questions of them and find them an acceptable answer. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course is divided into four main thematic areas, which focus on the role of courts and judges in modern society, the fundamental values the judiciary should protect, the actors (courts and judges at national and international level) and the unique characteristic of continental judiciaries. The core of the course rests on the theoretical background of individual aspects of the functioning of the courts and the discussion of selected decisions of the highest courts. The aim of this approach is to allow for a more challenging discussion of particular aspects of the functioning of the courts beyond individual litigation and to combine a political science perspective with a legal perspective. We will also focus on current issues (courts under attacks, the situation in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, but also in Latin America), as well as cross-cutting themes (Who should be a judge? Gender and its role in decision-making; The lay element - a relic or an expression of civil justice?) Each of the thematic areas II, III and IV is concluded with a special seminar (case study, debate with representatives of the judiciary, model parliamentary debate). ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The course partly builds on the knowledge acquired in the compulsory labour law courses and focuses on the identification and examination of special relationships of participation in work, which are regulated, in addition to the Labour Code, by special regulations such as the Higher Education Act, the Education Act, the Teaching Staff Act, the Law on Courts and Judges, the Law on Public Prosecution, the Law on Advocacy, the Law on Non-Medical Health Professions, the Law on the Conditions of Acquisition and Recognition of Professional Qualifications of Doctors and Pharmacists, the Law on Civil Aviation, the Law on Maritime Navigation or the Law on Local Government Officials. The educational objective of the course is to help students to improve the application of legal rules that modify the general rules they already know from a general course on labour law, and not in a superficial way, since individual laws hide many pitfalls, so the course is intensively focused on working with other sources, especially the case law of the high courts. A further aim is to hone students' legal argumentation skills in this area of special employment law, to guide them towards structured legal thinking through the writing of minor assignments of a clausal nature and, last but not least, to bring them into contact with positive law to advance their legal writing. Independent study of literature and case law is a prerequisite for mastering the course. The acquired knowledge will then be practiced in the course by solving model complex examples of higher complexity (based mainly on real cases). ",

        "LEARNING_OUTCOMES": " Upon completion of the course, the student will be able to identify a number of specific work participation relationships and understand their specificities reflected in different work settings. Following the content of the seminars, the student will be able to identify the legislation governing these relationships and will be able to apply that legislation, even if the legislation changes. The student will thus be able to make full use of the information, knowledge and, in particular, skills acquired in practice. In view of the above, after completing the course, the student will be better equipped to apply the law, to argue, to solve complex assignments. ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " The aim of this course is to provide insight into the multilevel aspects of European immigration and asylum policy and law. Whilst national sovereignty in matters of immigration is still recognized in principle, both international (human rights) treaties and EU law have increasingly determined the development of policy and law in this field during the last two decades. The determination of who is entitled to enter and stay in the Member States of the European Union, the development of free movement between the Member States, the removal of persons from the territory of the Member States, and the accompanying measures of border control, reception and legal enforcement, have all been affected by this development.\n    The course will address these issues, both with regard to EU nationals and their families and to third country nationals. This will include an analysis of the relevant provisions from EU law (EU citizenship, freedom of movement and the legal instruments adopted, since the Treaty of Amsterdam, in matters of migration and asylum for third country nationals) and from international law (Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, European Convention on Human Rights, Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families). The course will also focus on the institutional aspects like the role of the European Union and its impact on solidarity among Member States, and the role of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the EU.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Subject goal: The subject concentrates on specific problems of legal reasoning. Its goal is to introduce terminology of logic and the systhem of logical patterns, which can be applied in legal work. It contains purposefully chosen general information of logic which is targeted and systematized to be casily applied by the future lawyers. The main purpose of the Logic for Lawyers Course can be seen in acquiring basic theoretical knowledge of classic and non-classic logics (above all valid deductive inference, \u201especific arguments\" of the \u201ejuristic logic\", definition in law and deontic logic). Another topic which is considered quite important refers to the basic theoretical knowledge of legal reasoning (in terms of both formal and non-formal logic). In general: Logic for Lawyers Course aims at basic knowledge of classic logic and non-classic logic and also at logical basics of legal reasoning. Students are able to determine the formal validity of judgments in legal texts. Students are able to assess the proper use of basic logical connectives. Students control the application of legal definitions. Students practice working with the modalities of legal deontic logic. Students are able to correct errors in logical reasoning in legal practice. ",

After all, it is essential to approach the project creatively, use the correct legislative language, and defend the steps used. The main focus of the course is to write a legislative text. That is, to write a draft legislation based on an assignment (substantive intent). In doing so, care must be taken to respect the substantive (and policy) assignment, adhere to the rules of legal language, and be understandable. The draft must be logically and factually connected, which is difficult to achieve (until one becomes a routinist). In doing so, it is necessary to be able to justify the individual steps and the overall systematics of the legislation.

At the end of the course, the student will gain an overview of European criminal law, be able to navigate in this environment, analyse the legal instruments and compare the different institutes and instruments on the basis of the acquired knowledge. A significant part of the course will focus on the organisation and scope of the European Public Prosecutor's Office within the EU Member States and the Czech Republic. The course will also focus on the decision-making practice and the relationship between the ECtHR and the CJEU, as well as on the criminal law protection of EU budget funds. In the field of criminal law, the course will always include a body of substantive and procedural law. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " Criminal law I can be appropriate prerequisition ",
        "ASSESMENT_METHODS": " Education will be conducted by presentations and seminars, final coloquium (written essay from the presentations and seminars content). ",

The seminars are interactive, i.e. specific aspects of criminal law are transferred to the former EU pillar structure and to the legal environment of the Lisbon Treaty (regulations and directives) and the case law of the ECtHR and CJEU is explained and analysed in teacher-student cooperation. Cooperation with an external teacher - a prosecutor from the Supreme State Prosecutor's Office is used for interactive lectures and seminars. Within the interactive curriculum, mainly cases of ECtHR and CJEU decision-making practice will be assigned for solution. The students will apply the acquired knowledge in the preparation of final colloquium papers, the results of which will be discussed with the students during the colloquium either directly at the seminar (in the form of a pre-term) or in a separate term for the colloquium.

        "OBJECTIVES": " Spending and redistribution of funds from public budgets (on the state and municipal budget basis or on the basis of other entities managing public funds and regulated by specific European and national legislation rules) to support development activities in accordance with the interests of public authorities. Subsidy Law is a specific area of legal regulation with an interaction of traditional legal branches such as Administrative Law, Financial Law, Competition Law, etc. Drawdown of money from public budget is one of the most frequently used institutes by private and public sector. The issue of the subsidy policy and the correct drawdown according to the rules is receiving an increasing attention at the level of the Czech Republic and the European Commission. The economic competition and the European Union internal market are disrupted by the subsidies as an institution of subvention. Regulation of public support, public procurement and the subsidy cycle including sanctions for violations are an integral part of the process of the transparent management (redistribution) of the public funds in the way not to come about baseless favour of competitors and disruption of economic competition and the EU internal market. The aim of the course is to inform students about theoretical and practical aspects of the Subsidy Law including public support, public procurement and project cycle and sanctions such as for example discrepancy and collection. During the course we will pay attention to the following matters: - State subvention (the forms of the state subvention) - banned state subvention - European funds and current subsidy titles in pursuance of operational programs - the process of using the subsidies (filling an application for subsidies, decision on the award of subsidies, implementation, administration and sustainability) - public support and compatible forms of public support - procedures and decision-making practice of the European Commission and the courts - public procurement (proper procurement procedures, tendering, tendering by the Office for the Protection of Competition, procedures for grant providers and other control bodies (including audits) and imposition of sanctions for breaches of public procurement procedures, including the current decision-making practice of the Office, and courts) control mechanisms (audits, irregularities, breaches of budgetary discipline, recovery of provided funds) ",

        "OBJECTIVES": " Constitutional democracy is nowadays the dominant form of representative government in the world. Of this regime there is no comprehensive political theory. Next to political branches, elected and accountable to the voters through competitive elections, this form of government encompasses judicial organs exercising normative power through constitutional adjudication. This aspect of the judicial review will be analyzed considering the functions of Constitutional/Supreme courts in the world (focusing mainly on the countries that have, outside the US, the longest experience). Using an ideal typical taxonomy based on mechanisms of referral we will distinguish different effects of Courts\u2019 decisions on the working of the political and constitutional system. Some attention will be devoted at the historical origin of constitutional adjudication. Next to the main descriptive dimension of the seminar we will discuss the old question of the legitimacy of non-elected and non-accountable (to the voters) organs in democratic societies. The institution that we will spend the most time studying is the Constitutional Court, which was invented in Austria following World War I, as a part of the new Austrian constitutional government. It was then \u201creinvented\u201d following the Second World War in Germany and Italy and has been copied widely. But there are also other traditions of constitutional adjudication which locate the power to conduct constitutional review in a Supreme Court (which has also other judicial functions) as is done in the United States and Canada. Indeed there are much older traditions of constitutional adjudication that can be traced far back in history. ",
        "TEXT_PREREQUISITS": " Prerequisite: An introductory course in constitutional law in student\u2019s home country (can be waived under exceptional circumstances). Recommended: Acquaintance with the basic constitutional history and architecture of one or more countries other than the student's home country is recommended, as are keen interest in comparative constitutionalism.

Knowledge of the similarities, parallels and specificities is useful for better orientation in the Central European space and understanding of the many issues that are reflected in current legal regulations and approaches of these states. The course aspires to present the development of the state and law (mainly from a constitutional point of view) in the Central European area, focusing on the period from the 19th to the 20th century and then on the key areas of law, which will be further divided into public law (especially criminal and administrative law) and private law (especially civil, family and labour law).
